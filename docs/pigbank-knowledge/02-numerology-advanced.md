## Streets, Names and Addresses

Everything in life has energy, including the streets we live on, the names of businesses, and the addresses of our homes. Understanding this energy can help you make better decisions about where to live, work, or establish a business.

### Calculating Street Energy
To find the energy of a street, convert the street name to numbers using Gematria (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.) and reduce to a single digit.

### Calculating Address Energy
Simply add all digits in an address together and reduce to a single digit (unless it equals 11, 22, or 33).

Example: 1234 Main Street
1+2+3+4 = 10 (1+0) = 1 Energy

### Business Name Energy
The name of a business carries specific energy that attracts certain types of customers and success. Calculate using Gematria and consider compatibility with the owner's Life Path.

## Hidden Energy

Hidden energy exists in numbers that appear ordinary but contain master number vibrations. Understanding hidden energy reveals deeper meanings in dates, addresses, and personal numbers.

### Hidden Master Numbers
- 20 = Hidden 11 (2+0=2, but 0=9, so 2+9=11)
- 10 = Hidden 19 (1+0=1, but 0=9, so 1+9=10=1)
- 30 = Hidden 3 with amplified energy

### Finding Hidden Energy
1. Look for zeros in any number
2. Remember that 0 = 9 in hidden calculations
3. Recalculate with this knowledge

## Universal and Calendar Days
