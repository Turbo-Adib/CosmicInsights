# Letterology

Letterology is the study of relationships between letters and numbers, particularly each letter and its numerical value compared to gematria which focuses on the total sum of each letter in a word added altogether. The first letter in a word is represented by a number that defines the main (dominant) energy of that word. Words that start with the same letter have the same energy, also words that have the same letters in them have the same or similar energy.

## The First Letter

The first letter in a word or name is important because it is the most dominant energy in a word. For example, The letter **M**=**4** because it's the 13th letter in the alphabet (1+3=4), **4** is the number of law & order and structure, like the **M**ilitary, **M**atrix, **M**aster, **M**afia, **M**ason, **M**ob, **M**ogul. If your name starts with a **M**, it is aligned with all words, names, things and places that start with a **M** and all people, places and things that has 4 energy (also **H, Q, Z** words too — 4 & 8 are soulmates). Choose a career that starts with the first letter in your name or a career whose first letter is compatible with the first letter in your name.

**m** i l i t a r y  
m = 13 (1+3) = 4 = Structure/Law & Order

## Lowercase/Capital Letter Energy

Each letter in the alphabet has two numerical values (lowercase and capital). In Letterology, the main/dominant energy of a word is defined by the numerical value (number) of the first letter in that word. The lowercase numerical value for a letter in a word is always present even if the letter is capital, meaning capital letters carry both lowercase and capital letter energy.

### Example 1
**B**illionaire  
**B**ank  
**B**usiness  
b = 2 the Peace/Feminine/Female Energy  
B (Capital Letter) = 28 = the number of Wealth

### Example 2
**R**ich  
r = 18 = (1+8) = 9 = Adaptive/Egotistical/Illusion  
R (Capital Letter) = 44 (4+4) = 8 = Money/Power/Karma

## Letter Number Values

|--------|----------|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| A | 1 | 1 | N | 14 | 5 |
| B | 2 | 2 | O | 15 | 6 |
| C | 3 | 3 | P | 16 | 7 |
| D | 4 | 4 | Q | 17 | 8 |
| E | 5 | 5 | R | 18 | 9 |
| F | 6 | 6 | S | 19 | 1 |
| G | 7 | 7 | T | 20 | 11/2 |
| H | 8 | 8 | U | 21 | 3 |
| I | 9 | 9 | V | 22 | 22/4 |
| J | 10 | 1 | W | 23 | 5 |
| K | 11 | 11/2 | X | 24 | 6 |
| L | 12 | 3 | Y | 25 | 7 |
| M | 13 | 4 | Z | 26 | 8 |

## Examining Each Letter

**c r a z y** = 28 (2+8) = 1 = Aggressive/Argumentative  
3 18 1 26 25

**c** = 3rd Letter = 3 = Criminal Minded  
**r** = 18th Letter (1+8) = 9 = Egotistical  
**a** = 1st Letter = 1 = Aggressive  
**z** = 26th Letter (2+6) = 8 = Abusive  
**y** = 25th Letter (2+5) = 7 = Psycho

**e** = 5 = War  
**v** = 22 = Wicked  
**i** = 9 = Egotistical  
**l** 12 (1+2) = 3 = Criminal Minded

## Words Inside Words

Words that have the same letters in them have the same or similar energy. A word could be perceived one way and also have another meaning hidden inside the word.

**MODE** → **MODE**r**N**  
**LO**v**E** → **LO**v**ERS** → **LO**s**ERS** → **LO**n**ERS**  
**OVER** → L(**OVER**)s → DI(**VOR**)C(**E**) = Over  
**DEMON** → **DEMO**crat → **DEMO**litio**N** → **DEMON**strate  
**LO**s**E**

## Numerology/Gematria Connection

The energy of a word in numerology can reflect the actual meaning of the word.

**8 is the number of Power**
- Powerful = 44 in Gematria (4+4) = 8
- "**Low**" is found in the word P**ow**erfu**L**
- 8's are either High or Low in Life, no middle ground

**7 is the number of the Loner**
- **One** is found in the word L**one**r
- **One** is found in the word Al**one**
- One = 16 (1+6) = 7
- Loner = 28 (2+8) = **1**
- "A l**one**r is al**one**"

**28 is the number of wealth**
- "Young" = 28
- "Health is Wealth"
- notice the word "heal" is found in "(**heal**)th" and "w(**eal**)t(**h**)"

## First Letter in Your Name

Each letter in a person's name says a lot about who they are, especially the first letter. Definitions may also be applied to other letters in your name as well.

*Note: Refer to The Numerology number definitions for a more detailed description of each letter specifically paying attention to the number the letter it represents before and after it is reduced. For example, S=19 - 19 is the number of bad karma and sickness, 19 (1+9) = 10 (1+0) = 1 = Leader/Aggressive/Debater*

## Vowels and Consonants

Adding the vowels in a word/name (**A**, **E**, **I**, **O**, **U**) and **Y**, reveals its inner energy or inner character. Adding the consonants in a word reveals its outer energy or outer character. **Y** is the only letter that is added as both a vowel and a constant. Add Y as a vowel if Y comes before the first vowel in a name or word.

**h e a r t**  
Vowels: e a = 5+1 = 6  
Consonants: h r t = 8+18+20 = 19 (1+9) = 1

6 = Home & Family (Like the quote "home is where the heart is")  
1 = Will Power/Aggression (People with "heart" are considered brave)

## First Vowel in Your Name

The first vowel (**A**, **E**, **I**, **O**, **U**) and **Y** (if it comes before the first vowel, Example - Tyrese) reveals the real, personal reason behind all your motivations, a hidden energy of who you are (this applies to words too).
