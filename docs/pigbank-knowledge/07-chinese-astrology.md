# Chinese Astrology

Everything in the universe has a birth date and is imprinted with energy that is forever and cannot be undone. Chinese astrology is based off the planet Earth, where the energy of a person, place or thing is determined by the year it was founded in. People possess the actual energy of the animal from the Chinese animal year they were born in.

## Introduction

Chinese astrology is based on a 12-year cycle, with each year represented by an animal. Your Chinese zodiac sign is determined by the lunar year you were born in, not the calendar year. Each sign has specific characteristics, friend signs, and enemy signs that influence personality, relationships, and life events.

Key Points:
- Each zodiac sign is represented by an animal
- Your zodiac animal is determined by the lunar year you were born in
- Each sign has two friend signs and one enemy sign
- The Rat and Ox are unique as they are soulmates
- Chinese astrology ranks 2nd in importance after Numerology

## Chinese New Years

The Chinese calendar is based on the lunisolar calendar. Chinese years usually start and end between January 21st and February 20th, not on January 1st. If you were born before the Chinese New Year in any given year, you belong to the previous year's zodiac sign.

### How to Calculate Your Chinese Sign
1. Find your birth year
2. Check if you were born before or after Chinese New Year
3. If born before Chinese New Year, use the previous year's sign
4. Each sign repeats every 12 years

| Ox | January | Capricorn |
| Tiger | February | Aquarius |
| Cat | March | Pisces |
| Dragon | April | Aries |
| Snake | May | Taurus |
| Horse | June | Gemini |
| Goat | July | Cancer |
| Monkey | August | Leo |

This creates a dual personality system where your:
- Chinese birth year sign = outer personality
