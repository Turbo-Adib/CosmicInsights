## Shapes and Symbols

### Shape of Letters: First Letter in Your Name

Although a person's Life Path and Day Number play a major part in who an individual is, the first letter (in this case particularly the shape of the first letter) in a person's first name (middle names and last names too) are important.

Similar to Letterology, but instead of the number value of the first letter in a person's name, it's the shape of the first letter in a person's name that determines the type of characteristics that person might have. Also, this knowledge can be useful in naming a child, company, team, etc.

For example, an individual named "**W**illiam" is a disciplined but also stubborn person compared to an individual named "**S**ean" who is easily distracted with an open mind. William starts with a "W" which is a symbol with straight (aggressive) lines, while Sean starts with a "S" which has curvy (feminine) lines.

#### Letter Shape Categories

**Straight Line** - determined, disciplined, driven, has a strong focus to accomplish their goals, inflexible, stubborn, perfectionist

**Curved Line** - open minded, flexible, multitalented, highly creative, needs constant outlet to express themselves, easily distracted

**Curved-Straight** - balanced, flexible, focused, sees things from both sides, has both "straight line" and "curved line" qualities

### Shapes of Numbers

Numerology is superior and is at the top of the "food chain" (metaphorically speaking) when compared to all other forms of astrology because of the simple fact that everything in this universe relates back to numbers. Numbers (and also the shapes of numbers) are so powerful that they're used in everything in life, like, for example, when it comes to measuring time itself, such as the days in a month, months in a year, year in a decade, etc. and even the time of the day (numbers on a clock or watch). There's no such thing as a coincidence in this matrix.

Numbers are symbols that are symbolic for different types of energy. Each number has its own energy, and whenever or wherever numbers are found, this is an indication of imprinted energy and that the energy that the numbers (in question) represent is present. For example, if you are at a hotel with the address 3002 Sesame Street and the room number is 110, then the energy of that room alone is imprinted with 11 energy (attracts people like a magnet, emotional energy, etc.) along with the numbers of the address of that hotel (3002) reduced to a single digit's energy which would be 5 in this example (3+0+0+2=5). The 5 energy would be the main energy of the whole building, being that 5 is the energy of the address of the building, but that does not change the fact that the room number (110) is imprinted with 11 energy. This means the experience at that hotel in that specific room would be under 5 and 11 energy.

### Number Shape Meanings

The shapes of numbers are imprinted with energy and are so powerful that anything resembling the shape of a number will attract that energy is some type of way. For example, drawing the shape of the number 7 on a T-shirt or tattooing the number 7 on your body will attract injury, illness and bad luck, because 7 is the number of injury, illness and bad luck amongst other things.

Numbers and their shape relate to Numerology's definitions of each number:
- **1** is male energy and the leader. Notice how 1 is standing upright and firm.
- **2** is feminine energy, notice how 2 is kneeling or bowing
- **3** is the child, notice 3 is shaped like a baby sitting down
- **4** is structured, notice 4 is the only number closed in with sharp angles
- **5** is open minded, notice how 5 is open on both sides (left and right, top and bottom)
- **6** is overweight, notice the shape of 6's bottom half compared to its top half
- **7** is the number of injury, 7 is a curve line that comes to a point where it is bent at an angle as if the number was injured
- **8** is the number of balance (equal top and bottom half). The number of karma (what goes around comes around), notice 8 is a never ending loop (what goes up must come down) and is the symbol of infinity ♾
- **9** has a big ego. Notice the biggest thing is the top half of nine (the head)

### Altering Energy

The fact that there's power in the shapes of numbers, if you were to simply write/draw the shape of a specific number beside a set of numbers that's already on a specific object, the energy of the numbers that are on that object would be altered because of the number written beside the set of numbers but not completely because what is imprinted first can never be undone.

For example, if you own a house with an address that adds to 11 (never live in a 11 energy house, very emotional place), simply drawing a number with a magic marker (or anything to make your mark visible) such as the number 6 beside the address, will help to change the energy of that home to a 8 (money) to help sell it. Remember what is FIRST imprinted can never be undone, meaning the house will still always have 11 energy alongside the 8.

*Example*: 5006 Green St.  
5006 (5+0+0+6) = 11  
Drawing a 6 beside it will help change the energy  
5006**6** (5+0+0+6+**6**) = 17 (1+7) = 8  
8 attracts money and will help to sell the house, being that its forever imprinted with 11 energy

### Shapes and Letters: Intertwined

Below are examples of how numbers and shapes are intertwined in the universe.

**Snakes** - The letter "**S**" looks like a snake, (**S**)nake starts with the letter **S**. The letter **S** is the **19**th letter (19) in the alphabet. **19** is the number of sickness and bad karma. **S** looks and fits inside the number 8. The number **8** is the number of Karma & Power. Snakes are the bringers of sickness and bad karma, notice when a snake bites, it injects venom (sickness) into its victims. Also the snake can form itself into the shape of any number 1-9, people born in the year of the snake (Chinese astrology) are wise and powerful.

**The Number 9** - 9 is the number of Completion. Babies are born and ready to enter the world after 9 months. If you look at the number 9 it looks like a baby in the womb (9)

**4 and 7** - when you tilt a 7, it will fit inside a 4. 4 sucks the energy from 7 and is empowered by it…7 doesn't mind, but if you are a 7 and do mind, then distance your self from 4's. An example of this being successful would be a 4 life path launching something to do with knowledge or technology (7 energy) on a 7 day.

**8 and 33** - If you notice 8 consist of two 3's (33) one is backwards, 33 is the number of influence. 8's naturally have POWER and CONTROL in situations, which leads to having an INFLUENCE over situations. 33 Life Paths would benefit doing things under 8 energy and vice versa.

## Colorogy

In Colorology, each color has its own frequency that is determined by what number it adds up to in Gematria. Colors have the power to change the energy and mood of things, including a person's mood. For example, wearing the color orange will give you the power of influence. Or using the colors red, orange, blue or purple for a profile picture will attract people's attention. It's best to wear colors that are compatible with your Life Path Number.

### Color Meanings

**Green** - the color of wealth. In Gematria "green" = 31 (3+1) = 4, the secret number of wealth, and green is everywhere on Earth from grass, trees, plants etc., part of the reason the USA's currency is green.

**Blue** - the color of communication and trust. Notice the two most frequently used apps people trust: Facebook and Twitter icons are blue. Blue vibrates as a 4 and a 3 (with a capital B in gematria). 4 is the number of Law & Order (the boys in Blue), 3 is the number of communication. Wearing blue will help minimize problems with the law (unless the number 4 isn't compatible with your Life Path number). Blue also kills your appetite.

**Black** - sucks the energy of everything around it like a vortex. It is all encompassing. So if you wear it, nothing goes in or out.

**White** - is pure and holds all the other colors. It is reflective and protective. It is enlightening and cleansing. Amplifies your vibration.

**Red** - promotes willpower and stimulates vitality. Red is associated with anger, violence, energy and sex (5 is the number of sex). Red makes people hungry. Red gets people sexually aroused, grabs people's attention, think Lady in Red from the Matrix.

**Orange** - the color of influence. Wearing orange will help you influence situations or others.

**Purple** - the color of deception, attracts people's attention and is a color of influence (33).

**Gray** - a neutral color, people feel at home and you are not a threat when you wear gray.

### Color Energy Values (Gematria)

| Color | Lowercase | Capital First |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Red | 27 = 9 | 45 = 9 |
| Orange | 60 = 6 | 78 = 15 = 6 |
| Yellow | 92 = 11 | 104 = 5 |
| Green | 49 = 13 = 4 | 71 = 8 |
| Blue | 40 = 4 | 58 = 13 = 4 |
| Purple | 88 = 16 = 7 | 106 = 7 |
| Black | 29 = 11 | 47 = 11 |
| White | 65 = 11 | 83 = 11 |
| Gray/Grey | 50 = 5 | 68 = 14 = 5 |

### Adding Colors

Adding the gematria sum totals of colors together will determine the overall energy of a set of colors that are put together. For example, the colors in the Microsoft logo all add up to 28, the number of wealth (see example below). This can be used to your advantage depending on what you are trying to attract.

Example:

Microsoft's Logo Colors:
- Red = 9
- Blue = 4
- Green = 4
- Yellow = 11

Red (9) + Blue (4) + Green (4) + Yellow (11) = 28  
9+4+4+11 = 28  
28 = Wealth (naturally attracts wealth)

### Practical Applications

1. **Clothing**: Wear colors compatible with your Life Path for harmony
2. **Branding**: Use color combinations that add up to desired energy
3. **Home Decor**: Paint rooms in colors that support intended activities
4. **Profile Pictures**: Use attention-grabbing colors (red, orange, blue, purple)
5. **Business**: Incorporate wealth colors (green) or trust colors (blue)

Remember: Colors work in combination with numerology. Always consider your Life Path compatibility when choosing colors for important purposes.
