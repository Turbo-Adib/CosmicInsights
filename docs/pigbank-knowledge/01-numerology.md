# Numerology

Everything in the universe is imprinted with energy that can be felt and observed but not seen. Energy is forever and cannot be destroyed, only transferred. All types of energy coexist (exist at the same time and/or in the same place). Numerology is simply the study of numbers and their energy. In numerology, energy is represented by numbers. The most important energy of a person, place or thing is defined by what is called a "Life Path" number. A person's personality, strengths, weaknesses and life journey ahead are revealed by a person's Life Path number and also their "Day Number" aka karmic number (a person's literal day of birth). Though both numbers are important, a person's Life Path number is the stronger energy when compared to the energy of their Day Number. There are other numbers in an individual's birth date and methods that are used to calculate other energies that reveal other details about an individual and their life experiences as well. For example, the last digit in a birth year reveals a person's childhood.

Life Paths are calculated by adding all the numbers in a person's birth date together, then reducing the sum total to a single digit by adding the numbers in the sum together, unless the sum is 11, 22 or 33. These are referred to as the "Master Numbers" and they are never reduced, not even when calculating a Life Path. Master numbers are here to help guide the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The number 2 is only energy, not a Life Path. The number 0 is the hidden 9 and is discreet and hides the true nature of any number it's beside. The end goal is to fully become the energy you're born with. For example, if you're born with 3 energy (number of communication) you will learn to master communication or utilize communication to your advantage to succeed in this lifetime.

Even though all energy coexists, energy of the same frequency and/or compatible frequencies are always in harmony together, reasons why a person's Life Path can align with another person's Life Path and/or day of birth and vice versa. For example, an individual born a Life Path 11 is compatible with an individual also born a Life Path 11 and/or born on the 11th, 20th (hidden 11) or 29th. They're also compatible with someone born a 5 Life Path and/or born on the 5th, 14th or 23rd (days that reduce to 5) because 11 and 5 are soulmates.

Though we all have free will to go against any energy and suffer the consequences, the bottom line is, everything in life is connected to numbers and numerology is about accurate 95% of the time (give or take) and **SUPERSEDES** all types of astrology by far. Chinese astrology ranks 2nd most important after Numerology, then western astrology last. Western astrology is of the least importance compared to all other types of astrology (Chinese, Vedic, etc).

## Life Path Numbers

Your Life Path number is the most important energy in Numerology. Your Life Path is your whole life's journey ahead and who you are (and constantly becoming) and the powers or talents you were born with. Your life's mission is to fully become the energy you are born with (not someone else's energy). The universe (matrix) will put you through tests throughout your whole life as training to fully become, the energy (your Life Path), so you can complete this level and go to the next level (life path) in your next lifetime, as numerology is based off of reincarnation and your life path is the result of how well you've spiritually matured in your past lifetimes. Basically, everything you go through is determined by your Life Path number (and also your Day Number).

For example, if you are an 11 Life Path, your life will be emotional and filled with healing others (your self first), enlightening others and helping change peoples' lives. The matrix will constantly put you in emotional-baiting situations that will test you, forcing you to grow until you learn to control your emotions and the more you learn not to feed in or react in an emotional way, the more you will unlock your true potential as a Master Number 11, because with great power comes great responsibility. The same goes for every other Life Path number. For example:
- A 1 must learn to be a leader and be aggressive
- A 3 must create and master communication
- A 4 must learn to obey laws and become structured
- A 5 must travel (as being a hermit or staying at the same places far too long will cause them trouble)
- A 6 must nurture and care for others
- A 7 must learn to be alone, and seek/learn knowledge to teach others
- A 8 must learn balance and obey the laws of karma
- A 9 must learn to adapt and check their ego
- A 22 must learn to build/destroy and control their rage
- A 33 must enlighten/influence and check their ego

Also, remember there is no such thing as a 2 life path.

People who are un-evolved or immature versions of their Life Path tend to strongly possess the negative qualities of their Life Path number. For example, 3 is the number of the child, creativity and communication. An un-evolved 3 Life Path (or someone born on the 3rd, 12th, 21st, or 30th) is very childish, especially when it comes to how they communicate.

### Calculating Your Life Path

Calculate your Life Path by adding up the numbers in your birth date together, from left to right, one digit at a time, unless it's a **11**, **22** or **33** (never reduced master numbers), then reduce the total to a single digit.

Ex. **January 22, 1987**
1+22+1+9+8+7 = 48 (4+8) = 12 (1+2) = **3 Life Path**
Day Number = **22** (born on the 22nd)

The number **0** is the hidden **9** and hides the true nature of any number its beside. For example, **20** is the hidden **11** (2+9=11), again 0=9, but **0** is still to be added as a **0** when doing all calculations such as your Life Path number.

Ex. **January 20, 1981**
1+2+0+1+9+8+1 = **Impure 22/4 Life Path**
Day Number = **11** (20 = hidden 11)

---

## Day Numbers

The second most important number after your Life Path number (in Numerology) is called a "Day Number" aka Birthday Number. Your Day Number is who you are and the talents or powers you were born with, but also your karmic number. In other words, Day Numbers reveal the characteristics of a person, similar to that of a Life Path Number but Day Numbers are also the karma a person is born with (good or bad). Side-note, the first letter in your name in Letterology and also your first name reduced in Gematria is also very important, along with your Life Path and Day Number.

With 3 being the number of creativity and communication, an example of good past life karma would be someone born on the 21st (2+1=3) who is creative and has excellent communication skills, versus someone born on the 21st (2+1=3) with bad past life karma, who has trouble communicating and being creative (this individual will have to learn to overcome this in their lifetime).

Ex — 1/**12**/1968
Born on the **12th**
**12th** (1+2) = **3**
Day Number = **3**

Day Numbers are determined by reducing your day of birth to a single digit unless they're born on the 11th or 22nd of any month (master numbers are never reduced). Calculate your Day Number by adding the actual day you were born on together, from left to right, one digit at a time. Your Day Number is your actual day of birth if your day of birth is already a single digit (see below)

Ex 1 — 6/**2**/1977
Born on the **2nd**
Day Number = **2** (already a single digit)

Ex 2 — 6/**19**/1977
Born on the **19th**
1+9 = 10 (1+0) = **1**
Day Number = **1**

Ex 3 — 7/**22**/1999
Born on the **22nd**
Day Number = **22** (master numbers are never reduced)

Besides the 11th and 22nd, the 20th is the only other Day Number that does not have to be reduced (added) because 20 is the hidden 11.

Ex — 3/**20**/1991
Born on the **20th**
20 = hidden 11
Day Number = **11** (not 2, since 20 is the hidden 11)

## Life Path vs Day Number

Individuals whose Life Path number happens to be enemies with their Day Number tend to be more complex individuals compared to those whose Life Path is either neutral or compatible with their Day Number. The lives of individuals whose Life Path is enemies with their Day Number are complicated because, in some cases, the numbers their Life Path is compatible with can be enemies with their Day Number (at the same time) and this can cause friction, but being that the individual possesses both energies, the affects of enemy energy are lessened. To be on the safe side, using good judgment and sticking to the things that are your actual energy (your Life Path and Day Number) and things that are compatible with your Life Path and Day Number but are also not enemies with either of your numbers are best. More importantly, in Numerology, sticking to your Life Path's energy and its compatibility energies is the top priority overall if nothing else.

For example, an 11 Life Path born on the 1st (11 & 1 energy), encountering a person, place or thing with 9 energy. This individual's 11 Life Path and 1 Day Number are enemies to each other. 9 is enemies with 11 but is soulmates with 1. This individual possesses both energies, making the affects of the enemy energy between his 11 Life Path and the 9 energy weaker or lessened because at the same time, their Day number (1) is soulmates with the 9. (See below)

Example:
**Individual**
11 Life Path
9 Energy = Enemies
1st = 1 Energy
9 Energy = Soulmates

If you would rather stay clear of enemy energy completely, then align yourself with the numbers that are compatible with both your Life Path and Day number and/or the numbers that are compatible with either your Life Path and neutral with your Day number and vice versa, but do keep in mind, your Life Path number is the more important number.

For example, an individual who is a 11 Life Path born on the 1st, whose Life Path number and Day Number are enemies to each other (11 & 1), is compatible with a 5 Life Path and/or a place or thing with 5 energy. This energy is beneficial to that individuals' Life Path Number and Day number because 11 and 5 are soulmates, and 5 energy is friends with 1 energy. (See below)

Example:
**Individual**
11 Life Path
5 Energy = Soulmates
Born on the 1st
5 Energy = Friends

## Number Definitions

The following Life Path/Day Number definitions are to be applied to anywhere you see numbers, including any section in this book, and also any month, day, year, address, Life Paths of cities; states, companies etc. For the most part, wherever you see numbers there is a code (even your age), adding those numbers up together, from left to right, one digit at a time (unless it's a master number 11, 22 or 33), then reducing the sum down to a single digit will reveal the energy. But do keep in mind, in Numerology, the most important numbers that will reveal a person, place or thing's true identity are the Life Path and Day Number, the number of the first letter in their name (or word) in Letterology and the reduced number of their name (or word) in Gematria.

  - 11 Is a Number of Emotional Energy and It Makes Itself Easy for the 5 To Tap Into: Example Is Bernie Sanders, a 5 Life Path, Who Has Garnered a Huge and Legitimate Following by Tapping Into People's Emotions. Trump Has Done the Same and It Makes Sense Because He's Born on the 14th = 5.
  - Ex. Christine Lagarde (1/1/1956), a 5 Life Path, Became the Finance Minister of France in her 11 Personal Year (1/1/2007=11) and It Catapulted Her Into Becoming One of the Most Powerful Women on Earth. She Went on To Lead the IMF and in her 5 Personal Year Too but It all Started With That 11 Momentum.
  - Ex. Truth Is That if NBA Wasn't Founded on 6/6/1946 = 5 Universal Day, Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant (Both 11 Life Paths) Wouldn't Be Considered the Greatest NBA Players of all Time Even Though 11 Is Athletic. It's Because of the 5 Energy. Also Why Kareem Abdul Jabbar, a 5 Life Path, Holds the Record for Most Career Points
• **Secret #2:** 5 Is the Beginning of War, but 11 Is its Continuation. This Is Why WWI, Which Started and Ended on a 5 Day, Was Ended on 11/11 at the 11th Hour. It Helped Guarantee WWII. Why 9-11-2001 =5 =Endless War (on Terror). 5 and 11 Are Soulmates.
• **Secret #3:** 5 Is Able To Seduce Wealth Out of the Number 4.
• **Friendly Numbers: 7 and 33**
  - Michael Jordan Wore Jersey #23=5 and Scottie Pippen Wore #33 = Arguably Greatest Duo of all Time in NBA History
  - Catherine Zeta Jones (5 Life Path) and Michael Douglas (7 Life Path)- She Had no Reason To Be Married to Him This Long as She's Much Younger and Has her Own Money and Fame.
  - Franklin D. Roosevelt Was a 5 Life Path and Eleanor Roosevelt, a Very Significant Woman in American History and his Wife, Was a 33 Life Path. Solid Combination.
• **Secret Soulmate/Savior: 6** – the 5 Has a Love/Hate Relationship With the 6, but the 6 Is a Solid Long-Term Partner for the 5 Because Ultimately, Especially With Age, the 5 Needs To Calm Down and Settle a Bit More or It Can Become a Total Loser in Life, Unable To Commit to Anything or Support Anyone Including Itself. Constant Freedom & Change Comes With its Downsides, and the 6 Helps the 5 Plug in These Downsides. The 6 Likes the 5 More Than the 5 Likes the 6, but in Time the 5 Comes to Really Appreciate the Responsible, Calm, Settled Nature of the 6 and How It Helps Balance out the 5.
  - Best Time To Have Sex To Create a Family Is Between 11:55pm-12:05pm (Ejaculation) on a 5 and 6 Day.
• **Enemy Number: 8**. While 8 and 5 Don't Really Hate Each Other Personally, They Fail in the Long-Term Under Each Other's Energy. 5 Needs To Be Free and Have It's Space. 8 Wants To Own and Command. 5 Can't Live Under That, and 8 Hates Rebels.

### 6: THE HOMEBODY
• 6 Is the Number of Home and Family
• Number of Comfort - People Feel at Home With 6
• Number of Friendship - 6 Are the Best Friends
• Homebody (Very Lazy)
• The Family Man/Woman — Very Family Oriented

• Often Your "Average Joe" Kind of Person
• Many 6's Struggle With Obesity
• Animal Lover (Like Steve Irwin and Jane Goodall)
• Probably the Dumbest Number When It Comes to Intelligence
• 80% of 6's Are Dorks
• 6 Is a Unintelligent Number Overall, but About 10% of Them Complete Geniuses- Competitive With 7's and 33's in This Regard
• 6 Usually Very Well Equipped and Good in the Bedroom, Especially Men. They Are Able To Convince 5 Women To Finally Settle Down Because of This.
• 666 = # of Time - 60 Seconds=1 Minute, 60 Minutes=1hr, 24(6) Hours in a Day.
• 666 a Combination of 3 Sixes. 3=Children. Six Is Strongly Linked to SEX and Procreation for a Family. 666=18=9. 9 Is the Number of Endings. So Perverted Meaning Behind 666= It's a Universal Symbol of Victory for the Pedo Elite Who Want To End the Family and Take Ownership of the Children. They Want You To Fear and Hate 666 so It Can Create More of the Reality They Desire Because What You Hate, You Create.
• **Secret Soulmate: 5** - the **6** Saves the 5 From its Self and its Risky Behavior, and Gives It a Great Family Life Long-Term. 5 Makes 6 Less Boring. They Are Secret Soulmates, but It Takes Time for It To Show and Work Because It's Very Complementary Relationship, With Each Number Plugging in the Other's Weaknesses. 5 Is Sex, but 6 Is Fertility. Both Needed Together.
• **Soulmate Number: 33**
  - The Two 3's in 33 Are What Make 6 the Most Joyous in Many Ways. 6 Is the Number of Family, and 3 Is the Number of the Child.
  - 3 Life Path Won't Appreciate 6 the Right Way, Until It Loses It, but 6 Plays a Very Important Role for 3
  - But the 33 Life Path Is a More Advanced Soul and Believes in the Concept of "Family First," in a Big Way. 6 Is the Number of Family.
  - Ex. Steve Irwin, 6 Life Path, Famous Show "the Crocodile Hunter," Started on 10/25/1996 = 33.
  - George Steinbrenner, a 6 Life Path, Had a Very Long, Strong Marriage (til his Death) Joan Steinbrenner, a 33 Life Path.
  - Joy Behar, a 6 Life Path, Was Chosen To Be a Host on the View in her 33 Personal Year (10/7/1996=33). Show Started in August 1997 With Two Months Left To Go in her 33 Personal Year. This Part of the Reason It's a Big Success and She Got So Famous From It.
  - 6 Loves the 3, but the 3 Doesn't Always Love the 6 Back Until It Loses It. Steve Irwin Was Killed by an Animal (He Loved) on 9/4/2006 = 3 Day. The 4th Was Also Striking Back Against Irwin, but We'll Get to That Secret in a Minute.
  - The 6 Life Path Loves Children, and This Can Come Off as Creepy to Other People Especially Grown Men. Michael Jackson, 6 Life Path, Was Accused of Being a Pedophile; Many People Thinks He Was Very Misunderstood About his Love for Children
• **Best Friend Number: 8**
  - Ex. Michael Jackson and Liz Taylor (8 Life Path) Were Best Friends
  - Richard Nixon Would've Been Completely Screwed Without 8 Life Path Gerald Nixon Succeeding Him as President and Pardoning Him. This Pardon for Nixon's Crimes Was Extremely Controversial.
• **Secret: Opposite One Sided Relationship With 4**
  - 6 Siphons off Energy From the 4 and Often Takes Advantage of It. There's a Balance to Everything. The Same Way 4 "Cheats" the 7 but Sucking It's Energy (Though 7 Doesn't Mind), 6 Does the Same to 4 (and 4 Doesn't Mind).
  - Ex. Buckminster Fuller (Impure 33 Which Vibrates Like a 6 More Frequently)- Became Famous Off the Geodesic Dome That Walther Bauersfeld Actually Created a Quarter Century Earlier
  - Ex. Roger Ebert Was a 4 Life Path Who Had his Energy Sucked Away by his Wife, Born 10/15/1952=6 Life Path. He Didn't Marry Her Until He Was 50 and Started Having Health Issues Until After Their Marriage. It Ended Very Badly for Him Over a Long Period of Time. While Women Don't Really Have an Effect on Their Husband's Health to the Same Extent Has Men Have an Effect on Women's Heath (Because Men Penetrate Women With Energy, Not the Other Way Around); in the Case of a 4 and 6, the Energy Will Be Sucked Just Like With 4 and 7 (but 4 Sucking the Energy out of 7).
  - Trump (4) Hates Rosie O'Donnell (6) Because He Became Aware of the One Way Energy Relationship Where She Was Just Sucking the Energy out of Him. Again Because Trump Is Actually More "Woke" Than Most People When It Comes to Energy, He Realized Energy Like Rosie Is Not Great for Him. But Most People Never Realize This, and That's Why It's Hard To Call It an "Enemy" Relationship as the 4 Doesn't Hate the 6 or Vice Versa...It Just Is What It Is...Good for the 6, Bad for the 4.
• **Enemy Number: 7**
  - 7 Is the Anti-Family Number. 7 and 6 Will Never Get Along or See Eye to Eye.
  - The 10% of 6's Who Are Geniuses Hate the 7's and Vice Versa; Jealous of Each Other's Intelligence
  - Most 6's Are Average Joes & Most 7's Are High IQs, Which Creates a Mismatch
  - Most 6's Love People and Children, and Most 7's Do Not
  - 6 Extracts Energy From the 4, Which Extracts Energy From the 7 So in an Indirect but Efficient Manner, 6 Is Actually Extracting Energy From the 7 (Part of Why 10% of 6's Got So Smart)
  - Ex. Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and Blue Origin Is a 6 Life Path and Hates Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and Space X, Who Is a 7 Life Path. They're Constantly Competing, Talking Shit, and Trying To Take Each Other Out.
  - 7 Has Many Enemies, but 6 Is Probably It's Worst

• Bad at Communicating/Has Trouble Communicating - Will Have To Learn To Overcome This — 7's Can't Communicate Their Intelligence and Bring It Down to a Lower Level for the Masses Effectively, Like a 33 Can
• Energy Is Vulnerable to Homosexuality Programming
• 7's Can Often Be (P)erverts and They Are One of the Top Energies in (P)orn, P Is the 16th Letter in the Alphabet 1+6=7
• 7's Should Be Careful About Spending Too Much Time With 4's Who Will Suck Their Energy, Intelligence, and Claim Credit for 7's Work
• People Born on the 25th Can Be Very Problematic From a Mental Health Standpoint, Especially **May 25th** - Considered the Worst Birthday To Have, Feb 11th Is Another One.
• 7 Life Paths and 9 Life Paths Are the Most Prone To Vax Injuries
• **Soulmate Number: None**. But **11** Works as a Soulmate Because It Makes 7 Feel Whole but 7 Has no True Soulmate. In Some Ways, It's its Own Soulmate Like 3, but 7 Also Hates Itself, Unlike 3 Which Loves Itself in Pretty Much all Things.
• **Friendly Number: 5 and 9**
  - Ex. Of 7 and 9 Would Be Jam Master Jay (7) and Reverend Run (9)
• **Secret:** 7 Desires To Be With the 11, but It's Not Out of It Actually Being a Good Relationship. 7 Is Stuck, Isolated, in This Reality and Wants To Find an End to It and Completion for Itself. 9 Is the Number of Completion. 7+11=18=9. 11 Doesn't Care as Much for 7 Because 11 Is the Most Emotional Number and Needs To Be Taken Care of in That Regard. 7 Is Incapable of Doing That Because It's the Lowest Emotion as an Energy.
• **Secret:** 7 Is Bad Luck, but Three 7's Put Together, Improve That Luck Greatly. 777=Much Better Luck for Those With Bad Luck. Elite Know This, and Put 777 in Casinos Everywhere Because It Attracts Desperate People With Bad Luck, Who Are Looking for a Slight Improvement in Their Chances. People's Energy Realizes This Subconsciously. So if You Have a Lot of Bad Luck, 777 Is a Step in the Right Direction to Improving It. You're Still Going To Lose Money at the Casino Because That's Just the Way Casinos Are Designed.
• **Enemy Numbers: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11** (Slightly Less), **22, 33**
  - 7 Is the Most Hated Number and Fails Under the Most Energies Out of any Number. If You Want Your Parents To Leave You Alone, Marry a 7. 6 Is the Worst of These Enemies.

• Many Ups and Downs in Life, in Weight, in Money, in Power, Etc., There's no Middle Ground for 8's. They're Either Real High or Real Low, no Middle Ground.
• 8's Whole Life and Success Is Based off of Karma — Everyone Is Affected by Good and Bad Karma but Karma Punishes 8's the Worst When They Create Bad Karma, Also Rewards Them in a Big Way Too. In Other Words Karma Is Tougher on 8 Life Paths — They Reap What They Sow. Whats Goes Around Comes Around.

• **Friendly Number: 6**

• **Enemy Number: 5.** While 8 and 5 Don't Really Hate Each Other Personally, They Fail in the Long-Term Under Each Other's Energy. 5 Needs To Be Free and Have It's Space. 8 Wants To Own and Command. 5 Can't Live Under That, and 8 Hates Rebels.
• **Secret:** if a New 8 Comes Into Your Life, It Means That You Can Expect Good or Bad: Money, Power, or Karma Related Issues
• **Secret #2:** Carrying $**8**, $**8**0, $**8**00, $**8**000, Etc., In Your Front Right Pocket Especially on a 8 Day Will Manifest More Money and Wealth (if Your a 5 Life Path Use the 28 Instead)

If 4 of Their Friends Are Millionaires They'll Become the 5th One. If 4 of Their Friends Are Drug Addicts They'll Become the 5th One.
• Most 9 Life Paths Are Very Much Slaves to Their Egos. Instead of Using Their Egos as a Tool To Become the Top of the Pack, They Have Their Own Ego Use Them To Maintain Their Position at the Bottom of the Pack.
• 7 Life Paths and 9 Life Paths Are the Most Prone to Vaccine Injuries
• **Most Likely To Be**: Drug Addicts, Thieves, Feel Entitled to What You Have, Cheat on Partner, Betray You, Think They Are Special (Biggest Ego)

• **Big Secret:** 9 Is the Ultimate Number of Manifestation. 9 Is the Number of Reality and Illusion, Notice How "R" And "I" Are the 18th (9) and 9th Letter. This World Is Built on Reality and Illusion. So if You Keep the 9 Energy Close to You, and Use the Secrets of the Law of Attraction, You Will Be Much More Effective in Manifesting Both the Reality and the Illusions You Want.
  - When 9 Is Introduced Into a Situation, Everything (Including People) Either Becomes a Better Version of Itself or Is Brought To Completion. Ex. 3+9=12, a 3 Life Path Born on a 9 Day Will Have Strong 3 Skills. So You Are Building on Your Own Energy Using the 9. 3x9=27 (2+7) = 9 = Completion.
• **Secret:** 0 Is the Hidden 9, Hidden in Plain Sight. 0 Is Secretive and Hides the True Nature of any Number Its Beside (Amplifies or Enhances It Too). Example
  - Although 3 Is the Number of the Child and Comedian, Unevolved 3's Can Be Child Molesters, Pedophiles or Sexual Predators. Bill Cosby Born 7/12/1936=3**0**, a 3 Life Path, Was Secretly a Pedophile for Years With Many of his Accusers Being Under the Age of 18, Allegedly.
  - The 9 Energy Represents the End of the Separation Between the Master Numbers (11, 22, 33) and the Non-Master Numbers (1-8). In Some Ways, This Makes 9 a Secret Master or the Most Masterful. The 9 Energy Is the Most Useful in Opening the 3rd Eye Chakra and Helping Support Your Path to Attaining the Crown Chakra

## Attitude Numbers

Your attitude number reveals how you come off or appear to others. It's how you act or had to become but not necessarily how you feel. It's what works best to achieve what you want. This sometimes attracts people who aren't compatible with you. This number is also your extra gifts and talents. This same method of calculation can reveal the hidden energy of a calendar day also.

Calculate your attitude number by adding your birth month and Day Number together, one digit at a time, then reducing it to a single digit.

Ex. a - **October 1st** (10/1)
1+0+1 = **2 Attitude Number** (also with hidden 11 energy **1**+0+**1**)
**2** = Number of the Diplomat, Peace, Feminine & Protective Energy
- October 1st - an individual with this birthday will succeed in life by having a more sensitive feminine approach to things even though they're born on a 1 day and in a 1 month (October) which makes them an aggressive person

Ex. b - **December 3rd** (12/3)
1+2+3 = **6 Attitude Number** with **hidden 33 Energy** 1+2(=3)+3 = **33** (influence)
**6** = Homeboy, Family Oriented, Nurturer Energy
- December 3rd - while born on a 3 day with childlike characteristics, an individual with this birthday has the power of influence & will succeed in life by being more at service to others (nurturer) and being closer with their family

### Attitude Number: Master Number Energy

There is a difference between October 1st (10/1) and January 1st (1/1).

In general, when adding numbers and you come across 1 & 1, 2 & 2 or 3 & 3 beside each other in any date or any set of numbers, it means master number energy (11, 22 or 33) is present.

Ex. a - **January 1st** (1/1) = 11
1+1 = **11 Attitude Number** (master numbers aren't reduced)

## Variations of Same Energy

There are various combinations of every Life Path and Day Number (and numbers in general). Advanced numerology takes a more in-depth approach to determining the details and other characteristics of a Life Path, by examining each digit in the sum total of the Life Path number (Day Numbers or any group of numbers also) before it is reduced to a single digit. The same applies for the sum totals of words in Gematria or any other set of numbers being added, before they are reduced. Also, the first number is also significant when comparing numbers that are identical but in a different order, like a 32 Life Path compared to a 23 Life Path, both 5 Life Paths with slight differences.

For example, in general, **20**, **29** & **38** are all **11** Life Path numbers with the same qualities of an **11**, but a **29** is a more feminine **11**, compared to a **38**, which is a more social and business-minded **11**. **20** is probably the most feminine and secretive **11** (feminine because of the 2 and secretive because of the 0). Also your Life Path indicates the age you'll have a turning point in life.

| Life Path | Components | Energy Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| 20 | 2+0 = hidden 11 (0=9) | 2 = feminine, diplomatic; 0 = 9 qualities, 0 hides true nature of the 2 & 11 energy; 11 = athletic, intuitive, emotional |
| 29 | 2+9 = 11 | 2 = feminine, diplomatic; 9 = introverted, artistic, adaptive, egotistical; 11 = athletic, intuitive, emotional |
| 38 | 3+8 = 11 | 3 = social, creative; 8 = business-minded, powerful, materialistic; 11 = athletic, intuitive, emotional |

Notice the difference between words (seen below) by looking at their sum total in Gematria. All the words below equal to 9 but are different types of 9 energy:
- Dick = **1**8 (1 = Aggressive Energy)
- Penis = **2**7 (2 = Feminine Energy)
- Pussy = **1**8
- Vagina = **2**7

### Same Types of Energy

Your Life Path number, Day Number and your Chinese astrology sign number (sign number or Gematria number or Letterology first letter number) can indicate people, places, things, years, days, months, etc. you will benefit from whenever or wherever your true (before being reduced): Life Path number, Day Number or Chinese astrology sign (sign number, Gematria number or Letterology first letter number) appears.

For example, 23 Life Paths or someone born on the 23rd of any month should have an overall good year in 20**23** because the 23 (23rd year of the 2000's) in 20**23** is aligned with their Day Number or Life Path number. Other 5 Life Paths such as 32's, 41's, etc. or people born on the remaining 5 days (the 5th and 14th) will also benefit in 20(**23**) because **23** (2+3)=5. Even people born in the year of the dragon (**32** in Gematria and the 5th sign), Pig (**23** in Gematria), Tiger (**32** in Gematria) and Snake (**32** in Gematria) will benefit from the year 20(**23**), and also in 5 Personal Years, 5 Universal years (such as 2012), and years whose digit(s) have a 5 at the end or equal to 5 (such as **2003**, 199**5**, 200**5**, 20**14**, 201**5**, 20**32**, etc.) unless other energies prevents this, such as enemy years in Chinese astrology or Enemy Personal Years in numerology occurring in the same year.

Example - People That Will Have a Good Year in 20**23**:
• 5 Life Paths
• People Born on the 5th, 14th and 23rd
• Dragons (5th Sign) Also Dragon = 32 (Gematria)
• Tiger = 32 (Gematria)
• Snake = 32 (Gematria)
• Pig = 23 (Gematria)

Also, compatible energies will also benefit from years with 5 energy such as 11 Life Paths and people born on the 11th, 20th (hidden 11) and 29th (because 5 and 11 are soulmates) or 7 Life Paths and people born on the 7th, 16th and 25th, because 7 and 11 are soulmates (in a way).

The bottom line is, your Life Path number, the day you're born on (Day Number) and Chinese astrology sign (sign number or Gematria number) can indicate people, places, things, years, days, months, etc. you will benefit from.
