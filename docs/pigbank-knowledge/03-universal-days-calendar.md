# Universal Days and Calendar

Every day consists of both universal energy and calendar energy existing at the same time. The universal energy of the day is calculated by adding up the current date from left to right one digit at a time, unless it's a **11**, **22** or **33** (never reduce master numbers), then reducing it to a single digit by adding the remaining numbers together unless it's a master number. Calendar day energy is calculated by reducing the calendar day to a single digit (if not already). The 2nd of the month is the only time a "2 day" occurs. The 20th is a 11 calendar day.

Side-note: The first universal day of a new year imprints an energy for that entire year also. For example, 1/1/2023 (1+1+2+0+2+3) = 9 = a year full of endings.

## Friendly Days

Days that are aligned with your Life Path and Day Number are beneficial. Sticking to your own energy (Life Path & Day Number) and numbers that are compatible with your Life Path and Day Number is best. For example, if you are a 7 Life Path (the number with the most enemies), you will benefit from doing things under 7 energy (except relationships) & your Day Numbers energy.

Ex: **7 vs 4**
Even though 7 and 4 are enemies, a 7 Life Path born on the 4th could do things on 7 days, 4 days or 8 days (4 and 8 are soulmates).

Avoid doing things under energy that goes against the very thing that you are trying to do. Such as, starting a business on a 8 universal day that happens to fall on the 9th (9 energy). 9 is the number of endings and partnerships and a business started on this energy will fail. So regardless, it's best to play it safe and avoid doing things that go against the energy of the day (unless it's your energy for the most part). Wouldn't recommend a 9 Life Path signing a contract on a 9 day either.

## Enemy Days

Each Life Path number and Day Number has enemy number(s). All people, places and things should be avoided whenever and wherever your enemy numbers are present (especially your Life Path's enemy numbers).

Keep in mind that your Life Path number, your Day Number and the number(s) they are enemies with, when planning or making major plans on certain days, months or years. Don't start any major plans in your enemy years, months or days. When planning things, avoid dates with enemy energy. find better days, months and years that don't have enemy energy attached to it.
