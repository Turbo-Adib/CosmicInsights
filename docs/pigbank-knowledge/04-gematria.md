# Gematria

Gematria is the method of interpreting the energy of words or phrases, based on the numerical values of their letters being added from left to right, one digit at a time, then reducing the sum total to a single digit, revealing the numerical value of that word. Each letter in the alphabet represents a number.

## How to Calculate

Add the word or phrase in question (**lowercase** values for the primary energy), from left to right, one digit at a time (unless it's a master number 11, 22 or 33), then reduce the sum to a single digit. Refer to the number definitions in numerology for detailed explanations of the sums of words or phrases.

**Disclaimer**: Every word in Gematria will NOT always demonstrate the number definition (in numerology) of the number it adds up to, it just means that energy is present even if the word doesn't reflect the definition of the number in numerology.

### Example Calculations:

**h o w a r e  y o u**  
8 15 23 1 18 5 25 15 21  
8+1+5+2+3+1+1+8+5+2+5+1+5+2+1 = 50 (5+0) = **5 = health** (Concern)

**u s a**  
21 19 1  
2+1+1+9+1=14 (1+4) = **5** = **Freedom** "Land of the free"

## Adding Lowercase and Capital Letters

Adding the numerical value of the capital letter, along with the remaining lowercase letters in a word from left to right one digit at a time, then reducing the sum total to a single digit will reveal a hidden energy for that word. Words should be added the way they appear.

For example, if the word "**MATRIX**" was the name on a building it would have the energy of the 1st and 3rd example (seen below) because the lowercase energy is always present. If the word "**M**atrix" was the name on a building it would have the energy of the 1st and 2nd example (seen below) because the first letter is capital and rest of the letters are lowercase.

**m a t r i x**  
13 1 20 18 9 24  
1+3+1+2+0+1+8+9+2+4 = 31 (3+1) = **4**

**M a t r i x**  
39 1 20 18 9 24  
3+9+1+2+0+1+8+9+2+4 = 39 (3+9) = 12 (1+2) = **3**

**M A T R I X**  
39 27 46 44 35 50  
3+9+2+7+4+6+4+4+3+5+5+0 = 52 (5+2) = **7**

## Words Are Connected

Words, names or phrases that have the same sum total (number) have the same energy and are also aligned with other words with sum totals (numbers) that are friends & soulmates (in numerology) to that sum.

**s h i p**  
19 8 9 16  
1+9+8+9+1+6 = 34 (3+4) = **7 (Anti-Relationship Energy)**

All Ships Will Eventually Sink — Notice Word "**Ship**" in the Words Below:
• Relation**ships**
• Partner**ships**
• Situation**ships**

The word "book" and "intelligence" both have 7 energy (see below). Books are full of knowledge. 7 is the number of the **genius** and **knowledge**.

**b o o k**  
2 15 15 11  
2+1+5+1+5+11 = 25 (2+5) reduces to = **7 (genius/knowledge)**

**i n t e l l i g e n c e**  
9 14 20 5 12 12 9 7 5 14 3 5  
9+1+4+2+0+5+1+2+1+2+9+7+5+1+4+3+5 = 61 (6+1) = **7 (genius/knowledge)**
