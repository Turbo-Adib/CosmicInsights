**NUMEROLOGY **

verything in the universe is imprinted with energy that can be felt and observed but not seen. Energy is forever and cannot be destroyed, only transferred. All types of energy coexist \(exist at the same time and/or in the same place\). Numerology is simply the study of numbers and their energy. In numerology, energy is represented by numbers. The most important energy of a person, place or thing is defined by what is cal ed a “Life Path” number. A person’s personality, strengths, weaknesses and life journey ahead are revealed by a person’s Life Path number and also their “Day Number” aka karmic number \(a person’s literal day of birth\). Though both numbers are important, a person’s Life Path number is the stronger energy when compared to the energy of their Day Number. There are other numbers in an individual’s birth date and methods that are used to calculate other energies that reveal other details about an individual and their life experiences as wel . For example, the last digit in a birth year reveals a person’s childhood. 



Life Paths are calculated by adding al the numbers in a person’s birth date together, then reducing the sum total to a single digit by adding the numbers in the sum together, unless the sum is 11, 22 or 33. These are referred to as the 

“Master Numbers” and they are never reduced, not even when calculating a Life Path. Master numbers are here to help guide the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 

and 9. The number 2 is only energy, not a Life Path. The number 0 is the hidden 9 and is discreet and hides the true nature of any number it’s beside. The end goal is to ful y become the energy you're born with. For example, if you're born with 3 energy \(number of communication\) you wil learn to master communication or utilize communication to your advantage to succeed in this lifetime. 



Even though al energy coexists, energy of the same frequency and/or compatible frequencies are always in harmony together, reasons why a person’s Life Path can align with another person’s Life Path and/or day of birth and vice versa. For example, an individual born a Life Path 11 is compatible with an individual also born a Life Path 11 and/or born on the 11th, 20th \(hidden 11\) or 29th. They’re also compatible with someone born a 5 Life Path and/or born on the 5th, 14th or 23rd \(days that reduce to 5\) because 11 and 5 are soulmates. 



Though we al have free wil to go against any energy and suffer the consequences, the bottom line is, everything in life is connected to numbers and numerology is about accurate 95% of the time \(give or take\) and **SUPERSEDES** 

al types of astrology by far. Chinese astrology ranks 2nd most important after Numerology, then western astrology last. Western astrology is of the least importance compared to al other types of astrology \(Chinese, Vedic, etc\).

**What's Your Life Path Number? **



Your Life Path number is the most important energy in Numerology. 

Your Life Path is your whole life's journey ahead and who you are \(and constantly becoming\) and the powers or talents you were born with. Your life's mission is to fully become the energy you are born with \(not someone else’s energy\). The universe \(matrix\) will put you through tests throughout your whole life as training to fully become, the energy \(your Life Path\), so you can complete this level and go to the next level \(life path\) in your next lifetime, as numerology is based off of reincarnation and your life path is the result of how well you’ve spiritually matured in your past lifetimes. Basically, everything you go through is determined by your Life Path number \(and also your Day Number\). 



For example, if you are an 11 Life Path, your life will be emotional and filled with healing others \(your self first\), enlightening others and helping change peoples' lives. The matrix will constantly put you in emotional-baiting situations that will test you, forcing you to grow until you learn to control your emotions and the more you learn not to feed in or react in an emotional way, the more you will unlock your true potential as a Master Number 11, because with great power comes great responsibility. The same goes for every other Life Path number. For example, a 1 must learn to be a leader and be aggressive, a 3 must create and master communication, a 4 must learn to obey laws and become structured, a 5 

must travel \(as being a hermit or staying at the same places far too long will cause them trouble\), a 6 must nurture and care for others, a 7 must learn to be alone, and seek/learn knowledge to teach others, a 8 must learn balance and obey the laws of karma, a 9 must learn to adapt and check their ego, a 22 must learn to build/destroy and control their rage, a 33 must enlighten/influence and check their ego. Also, remember there is no such thing as a 2 life path. 



People who are un-evolved or immature versions of their Life Path tend to strongly possess the negative qualities of their Life Path number. For example, 3 is the number of the child, creativity and communication. An un-evolved 3 Life Path \(or someone born on the 3rd, 12th, 21st, or 30th\) is very childish, especially when it comes to how they communicate. 



Calculate your Life Path by adding up the numbers in your birth date together, from left to right, one digit at a time, unless it’s a **11**, ** 22 **or **33 **\(never reduced master numbers\), then reduce the total to a single digit. 

Ex. **January** **22, 1987** 

1\+22\+1\+9\+8\+7 = 48 \(4\+8\) = 12 \(1\+2\) = **3 Life Path**

Day Number = **22 **\(born on the 22nd\)

The number **0** is the hidden **9 **and hides the true nature of any number its beside. For example, **20** is the hidden **11** \(2\+9=11\), again 0=9, but **0 **is still to be added as a **0** when doing all calculations such as your Life Path number. 

Ex. **January 20, 1981** 

1\+2\+0\+1\+9\+8\+1 = **Impure** **22/4 Life Path**

Day Number = **11** \(20 = hidden 11\)

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**What's Your Day Number? **



The second most important number after your Life Path number \(in Numerology\) is called a “Day Number” aka Birthday Number. Your Day Number is who you are and the talents or powers you were born with, but also your karmic number. In other words, Day Numbers reveal the characteristics of a person, similar to that of a Life Path Number but Day Numbers are also the karma a person is born with \(good or bad\). Side-note, the first letter in your name in Letterology and also your first name reduced in Gematria is also very important, along with your Life Path and Day Number. 



With 3 being the number of creativity and communication, an example of good past life karma would be someone born on the 21st \(2\+1=3\) who is creative and has excellent communication skills, versus someone born on the 21st \(2\+1=3\) with bad past life karma, who has trouble communicating and being creative \(this individual will have to learn to overcome this in their lifetime\). 

Ex — 1/**12**/1968 

Born on the **12th**

**12th **\(1\+2\) = **3 **

Day Number = **3**



Day Numbers are determined by reducing your day of birth to a single digit unless they’re born on the 11th or 22nd of any month \(master numbers are never reduced\). Calculate your Day Number by adding the actual day you were born on together, from left to right, one digit at a time. Your Day Number is your actual day of birth if your day of birth is already a single digit \(see below\) Ex 1 — 6/**2**/1977 

Born on the **2**nd** **

Day Number = **2 **\(already a single digit\)

Ex 2 — 6/**19**/1977 

Born on the **19**th

1\+9 = 10 \(1\+0\) = **1 **

Day Number = **1 **

Ex 3 — 7/**22**/1999 

Born on the **22**nd** **

Day Number = **22 **\(master numbers are never reduced\)** **



Besides the 11th and 22nd, the 20th is the only other Day Number that does not have to be reduced \(added\) because 20 is the hidden 11. 

Ex — 3/**20**/1991 

Born on the **20**th

20 = hidden 11

Day Number = **11 **\(not 2, since 20 is the hidden 11\)

**Life Path vs Day Number **



Individuals whose Life Path number happens to be enemies with their Day Number tend to be more complex individuals compared to those whose Life Path is either neutral or compatible with their Day Number. The lives of individuals whose Life Path is enemies with their Day Number are complicated because, in some cases, the numbers their Life Path is compatible with can be enemies with their Day Number \(at the same time\) and this can cause friction, but being that the individual possesses both energies, the affects of enemy energy are lessened. To be on the safe side, using good judgment and sticking to the things that are your actual energy \(your Life Path and Day Number\) and things that are compatible with your Life Path and Day Number but are also not enemies with either of your numbers are best. More importantly, in Numerology, sticking to your Life Path’s energy and its compatibility energies is the top priority overall if nothing else. 



For example, an 11 Life Path born on the 1st \(11 & 1 energy\), encountering a person, place or thing with 9 energy. This individual’s 11 Life Path and 1 Day Number are enemies to each other. 9 is enemies with 11 but is soulmates with 1. This individual possesses both energies, making the affects of the enemy energy between his 11 Life Path and the 9 energy weaker or lessened because at the same time, their Day number \(1\) is soulmates with the 9. \(See below\)

Example:

**Individual**

11 Life Path

9 Energy = Enemies

1st = 1 Energy

9 Energy = Soulmates



If you would rather stay clear of enemy energy completely, then align yourself with the numbers that are compatible with both your Life Path and Day number and/or the numbers that are compatible with either your Life Path and neutral with your Day number and vice versa, but do keep in mind, your Life Path number is the more important number. 



For example, an individual who is a 11 Life Path born on the 1st, whose Life Path number and Day Number are enemies to each other \(11 & 1\), is compatible with a 5 Life Path and/or a place or thing with 5 energy. This energy is beneficial to that individuals' Life Path Number and Day number because 11 

and 5 are soulmates, and 5 energy is friends with 1 energy. \(See below\) Example:

**Individual**

11 Life Path

5 Energy = Soulmates

Born on the 1st

5 Energy = Friends

**Number Definitions **



The following Life Path/Day Number definitions are to be applied to anywhere you see numbers, including any section in this book, and also any month, day, year, address, Life Paths of cities; states, companies etc. For the most part, wherever you see numbers there is a code \(even your age\), adding those numbers up together, from left to right, one digit at a time \(unless it’s a master number 11, 22 or 33\), then reducing the sum down to a single digit will reveal the energy. But do keep in mind, in Numerology, the most important numbers that will reveal a person, place or thing's true identity are the Life Path and Day Number, the number of the first letter in their name \(or word\) in Letterology and the reduced number of their name \(or word\) in Gematria.

• **One Sided Relationship With 7**- 4 Sucks the Energy out of 7 and Is Empowered by It, Part of the Reason the World Wide Web Went Up on 8/6/1991=7 Universal Day; To Empower Wealth and the Wealthy Even More. 

This Is Part of Why Wealth Gap Has Grown Massively Since Then. 4 Life Path Marie Curie Was Actually Not As Smart as her Husband Pierre, but She Worked With Him, Sucked his Energy, and Got More of the Credit Than She Deserved for her Discoveries \(Even Though She Was Smart\). It’s Not Really an Enemy Relationship Because 7 Is Mostly Cool With This Process, Even Though It Doesn’t Benefit Much From It. Donald Trump \(4\) and Roger Stone \(7\) Are a Perfect Example of This With Stone Going Down Protecting Trump. 

• **Opposite One Sided Relationship With 6 **\(See 6\)

• **Secret: 4**, the Number of Wealth, Often Likes To Give its Wealth to 5 Because It Obsesses Over the 5. This Is Why You Get Really Wealthy Countries Founded Under 5 Energy Like the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. 

## 5: THE TRAVELER 

• The Traveler

• Number of Entertainment \(Concerts, Parties, Clubs, Etc.\)

• Number of Hospitality, Sex, Good Luck and Health

• 5 Is the Number of Sex - 5’s Are Very Sexual 

• Number of Change - 5’s Lives Are Constantly Changing

• Number of Freedom - the USA Was Born on 7/1/1776 = 32/5

• Number of Good Looks, Especially Good Looking Women 

• Smartest Number After 33 and 7

• Needs It’s Space, Freedom, and Flexibility

• Indecisive — Changes It’s Mind Easily, Goes Back and Forth

• Risk Taker, Open Minded, Unpredictable, Entertainer, a Super Salesman

• 5’s in General Tend To Like 4’s and 1’s \(5 Women Tend To Like 1 Life Path and 4 Life Path Men Most\) 

• 5’s Are Also Healers Because of Their Sexual Energy

• 5 Life Path Women & Those Born on the 5th, 14th & 23rd Have a High Sex Drive \(This Also Applies to Men\)

• 5’s Can Be Whores, Home-Wreckers, Will Try To Get With Someone Who’s Already Spoken for— Even Their Friend’s or Relatives Partner. 

• 5 Life Path Man’s Downfall: Women and Sex — Sex Scandals Ex. R Kelly - 

1/8/1967 = 5 Life Path

• Possibility of Being Homosexual \(5 Is the Number of Sex\)

• 5’s Are Freaks in the Bedroom: in Gematria the Words “Penetrate” = 41 \(4\+1\) = 

5, “Fuck” = 14 \(1\+4\) = 5, “Booty” = 23 \(2\+3\) = 5 

• 5’s Like to Party, at Their Worst Can Be Drug Addicts, Alcoholics or Sex Addicts

• 5 Is the Energy of Great Conquerors and Rulers \(Like Augustus Caesar\)

• **Secret Power:** the 5 Can Easily “Place Themselves in Another Man’s Shoes.” 

• **Soulmate Number: 11 **

- Ex. Augustus Caesar Was a 5 and Would Never Have Been the Greatest Ruler in History Without Julius Caesar, an 11 Life Path Who Adopted Him

~ 14 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

- Ex. Abraham Lincoln, Probably the Greatest President in US History, Born 2/12/1809 = 5, and Came to Power in 1860 \(in his 20 Personal Year, Which Is a Hidden 11 Personal Year\). 

- Ex. Michael Jordan, an 11 Life Path, Greatest Basketball Player of all Time Wore the Jersey \#23 \(2\+3=5\) and That Energy Helped Him a Lot in Becoming the Best

- 11 Is a Number of Emotional Energy and It Makes Itself Easy for the 5 To Tap Into: Example Is Bernie Sanders, a 5 Life Path, Who Has Garnered a Huge and Legitimate Following by Tapping Into People’s Emotions. Trump Has Done the Same and It Makes Sense Because He’s Born on the 14th = 5. 

- Ex. Christine Lagarde \(1/1/1956\), a 5 Life Path, Became the Finance Minister of France in her 11 Personal Year \(1/1/2007=11\) and It Catapulted Her Into Becoming One of the Most Powerful Women on Earth. She Went on To Lead the IMF and in her 5 Personal Year Too but It all Started With That 11 

Momentum. 

- Ex. Truth Is That if NBA Wasn’t Founded on 6/6/1946 = 5 Universal Day, Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant \(Both 11 Life Paths\) Wouldn’t Be Considered the Greatest NBA Players of all Time Even Though 11 Is Athletic. It’s Because of the 5 Energy. Also Why Kareem Abdul Jabbar, a 5 Life Path, Holds the Record for Most Career Points

• **Secret \#2:** 5 Is the Beginning of War, but 11 Is its Continuation. This Is Why WWI, Which Started and Ended on a 5 Day, Was Ended on 11/11 at the 11th Hour. It Helped Guarantee WWII. Why 9-11-2001 =5 =Endless War \(on Terror\). 

5 and 11 Are Soulmates. 

• **Secret \#3:** 5 Is Able To Seduce Wealth Out of the Number 4. 

• **Friendly Numbers: 7 and 33 **

- Michael Jordan Wore Jersey \#23=5 and Scottie Pippen Wore \#33 = Arguably Greatest Duo of all Time in NBA History

- Catherine Zeta Jones \(5 Life Path\) and Michael Douglas \(7 Life Path\)- She Had no Reason To Be Married to Him This Long as She’s Much Younger and Has her Own Money and Fame. 

- Franklin D. Roosevelt Was a 5 Life Path and Eleanor Roosevelt, a Very Significant Woman in American History and his Wife, Was a 33 Life Path. Solid Combination. 

• **Secret Soulmate/Savior: 6** – the 5 Has a Love/Hate Relationship With the 6, but the 6 Is a Solid Long-Term Partner for the 5 Because Ultimately, Especially With Age, the 5 Needs To Calm Down and Settle a Bit More or It Can Become a Total Loser in Life, Unable To Commit to Anything or Support Anyone Including Itself. Constant Freedom & Change Comes With its Downsides, and the 6 Helps the 5 Plug in These Downsides. The 6 Likes the 5 More Than the 5 

Likes the 6, but in Time the 5 Comes to Really Appreciate the Responsible, Calm, Settled Nature of the 6 and How It Helps Balance out the 5. 

- Best Time To Have Sex To Create a Family Is Between 11:55pm-12:05pm \(Ejaculation\) on a 5 and 6 Day. 

• **Enemy Number: 8**. While 8 and 5 Don’t Really Hate Each Other Personally, They Fail in the Long-Term Under Each Other’s Energy. 5 Needs To Be Free and Have It’s Space. 8 Wants To Own and Command. 5 Can’t Live Under That, and 8 Hates Rebels. 

## 6: THE HOMEBODY 

~ 15 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

• 6 Is the Number of Home and Family

• Number of Comfort - People Feel at Home With 6

• Number of Friendship - 6 Are the Best Friends

• Homebody \(Very Lazy\) 

• The Family Man/Woman — Very Family Oriented

• Most 6’s Desire To Have Kids and a Family 

• The Nurturer - Loves Being of Service to Others Especially Their Family and Love Ones. Must Be Careful and Not Let People Take Advantage of Their Kindness. 

• The Chef \(Cook\) - 6’s Make Great Cooks 

• The Doctor or Nurse, the Therapist, Caregiver

• Community Worker \(City or Government Workers Included\)

• The Farmer

• The Politician 

• 6’s Will Do Great in Real Estate \(Houses\) or Home Cleaning Services \(Maid\), Landscaping and Lawn Services \(Cutting Grass\)

• Responsible - People Come To 6s for Advice

• Often Your “Average Joe” Kind of Person

• Many 6's Struggle With Obesity

• Animal Lover \(Like Steve Irwin and Jane Goodall\)

• Probably the Dumbest Number When It Comes to Intelligence 

• 80% of 6's Are Dorks

• 6 Is a Unintelligent Number Overall, but About 10% of Them Complete Geniuses- Competitive With 7's and 33's in This Regard

• 6 Usually Very Well Equipped and Good in the Bedroom, Especially Men. They Are Able To Convince 5 Women To Finally Settle Down Because of This. 

• 666 = \# of Time - 60 Seconds=1 Minute, 60 Minutes=1hr, 24\(6\) Hours in a Day. 

• 666 a Combination of 3 Sixes. 3=Children. Six Is Strongly Linked to SEX and Procreation for a Family. 666=18=9. 9 Is the Number of Endings. So Perverted Meaning Behind 666= It’s a Universal Symbol of Victory for the Pedo Elite Who Want To End the Family and Take Ownership of the Children. They Want You To Fear and Hate 666 so It Can Create More of the Reality They Desire Because What You Hate, You Create. 

• **Secret Soulmate: 5 **- the **6** Saves the 5 From its Self and its Risky Behavior, and Gives It a Great Family Life Long-Term. 5 Makes 6 Less Boring. They Are Secret Soulmates, but It Takes Time for It To Show and Work Because It’s Very Complementary Relationship, With Each Number Plugging in the Other’s Weaknesses. 5 Is Sex, but 6 Is Fertility. Both Needed Together. 

• **Soulmate Number: 33 **

- The Two 3's in 33 Are What Make 6 the Most Joyous in Many Ways. 6 Is the Number of Family, and 3 Is the Number of the Child. 

- 3 Life Path Won’t Appreciate 6 the Right Way, Until It Loses It, but 6 Plays a Very Important Role for 3

- But the 33 Life Path Is a More Advanced Soul and Believes in the Concept of 

“Family First,” in a Big Way. 6 Is the Number of Family. 

- Ex. Steve Irwin, 6 Life Path, Famous Show “the Crocodile Hunter,” Started on 10/25/1996 = 33. 

- George Steinbrenner, a 6 Life Path, Had a Very Long, Strong Marriage \(til his Death\) Joan Steinbrenner, a 33 Life Path. 

~ 16 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

- Joy Behar, a 6 Life Path, Was Chosen To Be a Host on the View in her 33 

Personal Year \(10/7/1996=33\). Show Started in August 1997 With Two Months Left To Go in her 33 Personal Year. This Part of the Reason It’s a Big Success and She Got So Famous From It. 

- 6 Loves the 3, but the 3 Doesn’t Always Love the 6 Back Until It Loses It. 

Steve Irwin Was Killed by an Animal \(He Loved\) on 9/4/2006 = 3 Day. The 4th Was Also Striking Back Against Irwin, but We’ll Get to That Secret in a Minute. 

- The 6 Life Path Loves Children, and This Can Come Off as Creepy to Other People Especially Grown Men. Michael Jackson, 6 Life Path, Was Accused of Being a Pedophile; Many People Thinks He Was Very Misunderstood About his Love for Children

• **Best Friend Number: 8 **

- Ex. Michael Jackson and Liz Taylor \(8 Life Path\) Were Best Friends

- Richard Nixon Would’ve Been Completely Screwed Without 8 Life Path Gerald Nixon Succeeding Him as President and Pardoning Him. This Pardon for Nixon’s Crimes Was Extremely Controversial. 

• **Secret: Opposite One Sided Relationship With 4 **

- 6 Siphons off Energy From the 4 and Often Takes Advantage of It. There’s a Balance to Everything. The Same Way 4 “Cheats” the 7 but Sucking It’s Energy \(Though 7 Doesn’t Mind\), 6 Does the Same to 4 \(and 4 Doesn’t Mind\). 

- Ex. Buckminster Fuller \(Impure 33 Which Vibrates Like a 6 More Frequently\)- 

Became Famous Off the Geodesic Dome That Walther Bauersfeld Actually Created a Quarter Century Earlier

- Ex. Roger Ebert Was a 4 Life Path Who Had his Energy Sucked Away by his Wife, Born 10/15/1952=6 Life Path. He Didn’t Marry Her Until He Was 50 and Started Having Health Issues Until After Their Marriage. It Ended Very Badly for Him Over a Long Period of Time. While Women Don’t Really Have an Effect on Their Husband’s Health to the Same Extent Has Men Have an Effect on Women’s Heath \(Because Men Penetrate Women With Energy, Not the Other Way Around\); in the Case of a 4 and 6, the Energy Will Be Sucked Just Like With 4 and 7 \(but 4 Sucking the Energy out of 7\). 

- Trump \(4\) Hates Rosie O’Donnell \(6\) Because He Became Aware of the One Way Energy Relationship Where She Was Just Sucking the Energy out of Him. 

Again Because Trump Is Actually More “Woke” Than Most People When It Comes to Energy, He Realized Energy Like Rosie Is Not Great for Him. But Most People Never Realize This, and That’s Why It’s Hard To Call It an 

“Enemy” Relationship as the 4 Doesn’t Hate the 6 or Vice Versa...It Just Is What It Is...Good for the 6, Bad for the 4. 

• **Enemy Number: 7 **

- 7 Is the Anti-Family Number. 7 and 6 Will Never Get Along or See Eye to Eye. 

- The 10% of 6's Who Are Geniuses Hate the 7's and Vice Versa; Jealous of Each Other’s Intelligence

- Most 6's Are Average Joes & Most 7's Are High IQs, Which Creates a Mismatch

- Most 6's Love People and Children, and Most 7's Do Not

- 6 Extracts Energy From the 4, Which Extracts Energy From the 7 So in an Indirect but Efficient Manner, 6 Is Actually Extracting Energy From the 7 \(Part of Why 10% of 6's Got So Smart\)

~ 17 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

- Ex. Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and Blue Origin Is a 6 Life Path and Hates Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and Space X, Who Is a 7 Life Path. They’re Constantly Competing, Talking Shit, and Trying To Take Each Other Out. 

- 7 Has Many Enemies, but 6 Is Probably It’s Worst

## 7: THE LONER 

• Lone Wolf or the Loner

• The Genius: Extremely Intelligent and High IQ \(Like Steven Hawking\)

• 7 Is the Number of Knowledge 

• 7 Is the Number of Technology

• 11 and 7 Are the Most Spiritual Numbers

• Intuitive, Introverted, Distant 

• Mental Illness/Issues — Psychos, Heartless 

• More Book Smarts Than Streets Smarts Though

• Injury and Disease Prone - Injuries and Health Issues Are More Frequent for 7 

Than any Other Number. Strong Mind, Weak Body

• Will Have To Wear Glasses Towards the End or at Some Point in Their Life

• Bad at Relationships — 7 Is the Loner = Anti-Relationship Energy

• Most Unluckiest Number — 7’s Bad at Saving Money or Attracting Money

• Loves To Gamble \(Has Gambling Problem\)

• 7's Are Very Misunderstood by Most People

• 7 Women Are Turned on by Intelligence

• Do NOT Get Married or Start a Relationship on 7 Universal Days or the 7th, 16th or 25th of any Year. Any Relationship Started Under 7 Energy Will Fail \(Same Also Applies to 9 Universal Days or the 9th, 18th or 27th\)

• Bad at Communicating/Has Trouble Communicating - Will Have To Learn To Overcome This — 7's Can’t Communicate Their Intelligence and Bring It Down to a Lower Level for the Masses Effectively, Like a 33 Can

• Energy Is Vulnerable to Homosexuality Programming

• 7's Can Often Be \(P\)erverts and They Are One of the Top Energies in \(P\)orn, P 

Is the 16th Letter in the Alphabet 1\+6=7

• 7's Should Be Careful About Spending Too Much Time With 4's Who Will Suck Their Energy, Intelligence, and Claim Credit for 7's Work

• People Born on the 25th Can Be Very Problematic From a Mental Health Standpoint, Especially **May 25th** - Considered the Worst Birthday To Have, Feb 11th Is Another One. 

• 7 Life Paths and 9 Life Paths Are the Most Prone To Vax Injuries

• **Soulmate Number: None**. But **11** Works as a Soulmate Because It Makes 7 

Feel Whole but 7 Has no True Soulmate. In Some Ways, It’s its Own Soulmate Like 3, but 7 Also Hates Itself, Unlike 3 Which Loves Itself in Pretty Much all Things. 

• **Friendly Number: 5 and 9 **

- Ex. Of 7 and 9 Would Be Jam Master Jay \(7\) and Reverend Run \(9\)

• **Secret: **7 Desires To Be With the 11, but It’s Not Out of It Actually Being a Good Relationship. 7 Is Stuck, Isolated, in This Reality and Wants To Find an End to It and Completion for Itself. 9 Is the Number of Completion. 

7\+11=18=9. 11 Doesn’t Care as Much for 7 Because 11 Is the Most Emotional Number and Needs To Be Taken Care of in That Regard. 7 Is Incapable of Doing That Because It’s the Lowest Emotion as an Energy. 

~ 18 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

• **Secret:** 7 Is Bad Luck, but Three 7's Put Together, Improve That Luck Greatly. 

777=Much Better Luck for Those With Bad Luck. Elite Know This, and Put 777 

in Casinos Everywhere Because It Attracts Desperate People With Bad Luck, Who Are Looking for a Slight Improvement in Their Chances. People’s Energy Realizes This Subconsciously. So if You Have a Lot of Bad Luck, 777 Is a Step in the Right Direction to Improving It. You’re Still Going To Lose Money at the Casino Because That’s Just the Way Casinos Are Designed. 

• **Enemy Numbers: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11 **\(Slightly Less\)**, 22, 33** 

- 7 Is the Most Hated Number and Fails Under the Most Energies Out of any Number. If You Want Your Parents To Leave You Alone, Marry a 7. 6 Is the Worst of These Enemies. 

## 8: THE MONEY MAN 

• Number of Money, Power & Karma

• As Above, So Below \(8\)

• Infinity on a Closed Loop \(8\)

• Yin/Yang \(8\)

• Leader

• Abuse of Power, Takes Advantage

• Ignorant - Still Does Things While Knowing It’s Not Good for Them 

• Possessive, Demanding 

• Controlling: Likes To Be in Control

• Narcissist

• Revengeful — Hold Grudges and Wants Revenge \(Like a Scorpio the 8th Sign\)

• Greedy

• Opportunist

• 8’s Are Materialistic by Nature \(as They Should Be in This Lifetime\) Not Caring About Money Will Cause 8’s Trouble They Must Become the Energy and Be About Money

• Many Ups and Downs in Life, in Weight, in Money, in Power, Etc., There’s no Middle Ground for 8’s. They’re Either Real High or Real Low, no Middle Ground. 

• 8’s Whole Life and Success Is Based off of Karma — Everyone Is Affected by Good and Bad Karma but Karma Punishes 8’s the Worst When They Create Bad Karma, Also Rewards Them in a Big Way Too. In Other Words Karma Is Tougher on 8 Life Paths — They Reap What They Sow. Whats Goes Around Comes Around. 

• Puts the “Command” in “Command and Control,” With its Soulmate 4 Being the Control Part. 

• Indecisive at First, but Once It Decides on Something, It Goes Hard on That Decision \(Unlike 5 Which Remains Doubtful and Indecisive\)

• More Artistic Than Most People Realize \(Michelangelo, Picasso, Etc.\)

• 50/50 - Some Are Dictators, Some Are Great Inclusive Leaders

• In General, Don’t Argue Too Much With an 8. They Don’t Like Debates, and Will Bring Down the Hammer Hard on You. 

• **Soulmate Number: 4**

• **Friendly Number: 6**

• **Love/Hate Relationship With 1 **

~ 19 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

• **Enemy Number: 5. **While 8 and 5 Don’t Really Hate Each Other Personally, They Fail in the Long-Term Under Each Other’s Energy. 5 Needs To Be Free and Have It’s Space. 8 Wants To Own and Command. 5 Can’t Live Under That, and 8 Hates Rebels. 

• **Secret:** if a New 8 Comes Into Your Life, It Means That You Can Expect Good or Bad: Money, Power, or Karma Related Issues

• **Secret \#2:** Carrying $**8**, $**8**0, $**8**00, $**8**000, Etc., In Your Front Right Pocket Especially on a 8 Day Will Manifest More Money and Wealth \(if Your a 5 Life Path Use the 28 Instead\)

## 9: THE ADAPTER 

• The Number of Endings \(Also Death\) and Completion

• The Vice President – 9 Is Great at “Leading From Behind,” and This Is Why It Works So Well With the Number 1, Who Leads out Front

• Good Leader and Good Follower

• One of the Smarter Numbers After 33, 7 and 5

• Model - Usually Very Attractive and Well Proportioned Bodies

• The Actor/Actress, Performer, Singer, Dancer, Musical Artist \(Very Artistic\)

• 9 Is the Adapter \(the Transformer\), Thinks Quickly and Effectively on It’s Feet

• 9s Are Very Egotistical —Their Biggest Down Fall

• Has the Biggest Ego for Accomplishing NOTHING

• Most 9’s Are Mentally Ill \(They Live in a Fantasy Land\) or Drug Addicts

• Conceited —Full of Themselves, Feels Complete Even if They’re Not

• Introverted, Lives in Their Head and Has a Complicated Personality 

• Hates To Experience New Things That Will in the End Make Them More Wise

• Adaptive Personality - 9 Life Paths & People Born on the 9th 18th & 27th Have Problems With Addiction, They Need To Watch Who They Hang Around Because They Will Adapt & Double Down on Whatever It Is They're Influenced by Good or Bad. If 4 of Their Friends Are Millionaires They’ll Become the 5th One. If 4 of Their Friends Are Drug Addicts They’ll Become the 5th One. 

• Most 9 Life Paths Are Very Much Slaves to Their Egos. Instead of Using Their Egos as a Tool To Become the Top of the Pack, They Have Their Own Ego Use Them To Maintain Their Position at the Bottom of the Pack. 

• 7 Life Paths and 9 Life Paths Are the Most Prone to Vaccine Injuries

• **Most Likely To Be**: Drug Addicts, Thieves, Feel Entitled to What You Have, Cheat on Partner, Betray You, Think They Are Special \(Biggest Ego\) 

• Has Problems With Family \(Black Sheep\) 9 Is a 6 Upside Down, 6 = Family 

• Most Souls Fail Their 9 Life Path Reincarnation & Have To Repeat It Over 

• 9 Is the Last Reincarnation Before Becoming a Master Number 11, 22, Then the 33 \(Last Reincarnation\)

• 9 Is Also Strongly Linked to 2, Reason Why 2 Is Called the Femi\(NINE\)

• **Big Secret:** 9 Is the Ultimate Number of Manifestation. 9 Is the Number of Reality and Illusion, Notice How “R” And “I” Are the 18th \(9\) and 9th Letter. 

This World Is Built on Reality and Illusion. So if You Keep the 9 Energy Close to You, and Use the Secrets of the Law of Attraction, You Will Be Much More Effective in Manifesting Both the Reality and the Illusions You Want. 

- When 9 Is Introduced Into a Situation, Everything \(Including People\) Either Becomes a Better Version of Itself or Is Brought To Completion. 

~ 20 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

Ex. 3\+9=12, a 3 Life Path Born on a 9 Day Will Have Strong 3 Skills. So You Are Building on Your Own Energy Using the 9. 3x9=27 \(2\+7\) = 9 = Completion. 

• **Secret: **0 Is the Hidden 9, Hidden in Plain Sight. 0 Is Secretive and Hides the True Nature of any Number Its Beside \(Amplifies or Enhances It Too\). Example 

- Although 3 Is the Number of the Child and Comedian, Unevolved 3’s Can Be Child Molesters, Pedophiles or Sexual Predators. Bill Cosby Born 7/12/1936=3**0**, a 3 Life Path, Was Secretly a Pedophile for Years With Many of his Accusers Being Under the Age of 18, Allegedly. 

- The 9 Energy Represents the End of the Separation Between the Master Numbers \(11, 22, 33\) and the Non-Master Numbers \(1-8\). In Some Ways, This Makes 9 a Secret Master or the Most Masterful. The 9 Energy Is the Most Useful in Opening the 3rd Eye Chakra and Helping Support Your Path to Attaining the Crown Chakra

- If There’s Ever Utopia on Earth, 9 Will Be a Major Reason Behind It

• **Soulmate Number: 1**

• **Friendly Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 **

**• Enemy Numbers: 11, 22, 33 **

• 11 = Inconsistent Wealth - Rich = 29/11 in Gematria

• Very Influential, Inspires Others - 11 Energy Affects People Emotionally 

• Natural Charisma - People Are Drawn to 11’s \(Like Magnets\) Because of This.

- Ex. Almost all of the Royal Family Are 11 Life Paths - David Has C-Sections To Make Sure That They Was Born on the 11th or an 11 Life Path

• Fits in Society by Fitting Out of Society \(11s Are Misunderstood\)

• Upbringing Can Be Difficult, Parents of an 11, 22 or 33 Child Must Be Patient With Them & Allow Them To Grow, the Matrix Tests Them the Most. 

~ 21 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

• Late Bloomers With More To Achieve

• Highly Intuitive, Easily Picks Up on Other People's Auras

• Empaths - Sensitive to the Energy of Others, Also Shouldn’t Drink or Do Drugs as 11’s Are Inclined to Bad Habits, Must Be Careful With That 

• When an 11 Is Down They Drain the Energy of Everyone in the Room

• Technology Malfunctions Under 11 Energy, Ex. Airplanes Crashes

• Has an Old Soul, That’s Been Reincarnated Many Times Gaining Spiritual Wisdom and Knowledge, Have To Earn the Right To Be Born an 11 Life Path. 

• Seeing 11:11 = Your 3rd Eye Is Opening/Your Evolving and on the Right Path

• People Get Killed or Commit Suicide Under 11 Energy \(Emotional\)

• The Government Does Things Under 11 Energy \(Emotional Energy\) To Get People Emotionally Involved: Ex - Terrorist Attacks on 9/11: the Age of Aquarius \(the 11th Sign\) Started 9-11-2001 When Flight 11 \(Airplane\) Hit the World Trade Center on the 11th and the Pentagon \(11 Letters\) in New York City \(11 Letters\) - New York = 11th State in Union, Then in Relation Afghanistan \(11 

Letters\) Was Attacked by the USA on 10-7-2001 \(1\+0\+7\+2\+0\+0\+1\)=11

• 20 Is the Secret 11 Hidden in Plain Sight \(2\+9=11\) 0=9

• **Secret: **7 Desires To Be With the 11, but It’s Not Out of It Actually Being a Good Relationship. 7 Is Stuck, Isolated, in This Reality and Wants To Find an End to It and Completion for Itself. 9 Is the Number of Completion. 

7\+11=18=9. 11 Doesn’t Care as Much for 7 Because 11 Is the Most Emotional Number and Needs To Be Taken Care of in That Regard. 7 Is Incapable of Doing That Because It’s the Lowest Emotion as an Energy

• **Soulmate Number: 5 **

- 11 Is Emotional Energy and It Makes Itself Easy for the 5 To Tap Into 

- Ex. Michael Jordan, an 11 Life Path, Greatest Basketball Player of all Time Wore the Jersey \#23 \(2\+3=5\) and That Energy Helped Him a Lot in Becoming the Best

- Ex. If the NBA Wasn’t Founded on 6/6/1946=5 Day, Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant \(Both 11 Life Paths\) Wouldn’t Be Considered the Greatest NBA Players of all Time Even Though 11 Is Athletic. It’s Because of the 5 Energy. 

- Ex. Abraham Lincoln \(President in US\), Born 2/12/1809=5, and Came to Power in 1860 \(in his 20 Personal Year, Which Is a Hidden 11 Personal Year\). 

- Ex. Christine Lagarde \(1/1/1956\), a 5 Life Path, Became the Finance Minister of France in her 11 Personal Year \(1/1/2007=11\) and It Catapulted Her Into Becoming One of the Most Powerful Women on Earth. She Went on To Lead the IMF and in her 5 Personal Year Too but It all Started With That 11 

Momentum. 

• **Secret \#2:** 5 Is the Beginning of War, but 11 Is its Continuation. This Is Why WWI, Which Started and Ended on a 5 Day, Was Ended on 11/11 at the 11th Hour. It Helped Guarantee WWII. Why 9-11-2001=5=Endless War\(on Terror\). 

Again, 5 and 11 Are Soulmates. 

**• Friendly Number: 33 **

**• Enemy Numbers: 1 and 9 **- When 9 & 11 Are Together Its Always Some Sort of Destruction Like the Twin Towers Being Destroyed on 9/11. Police Tell You to Dial “911” and Majority of 911 Calls Are Dealing With Something Negative. 

**- **NBA Players Kobe Bryant \(11 Life Path\) and Shaquille O'Neal \(1 Life Path\), Also Enemy Signs \(Horse vs Rat\) in Astrology. 

**- **In the TV Series “Stranger Things” the Main Character Named “11” and the Villain \(Enemy\) Name Is “1” \(11 vs 1\)

**22: THE MASTER BUILDER **

• The Architect, the Coach

**Key Notes: **

• All Life Paths are soulmate numbers to a person born on the 2nd

• 2 is soulmates to people born on the 1st, 9th, 10th, 18th, 19th, 27th & 28th

• 8 is soulmates with 4, but is also a good match with 22 \(partial 4 energy\)

• 11 makes 7 feel whole 11\+7=18=9 is the \# of completion

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Variations of the Same Energy **



There are various combinations of every Life Path and Day Number \(and numbers in general\). Advanced numerology takes a more in-depth approach to determining the details and other characteristics of a Life Path, by examining each digit in the sum total of the Life Path number \(Day Numbers or any group of numbers also\) before it is reduced to a single digit. The same applies for the sum totals of words in Gematria or any other set of numbers being added, before they are reduced. Also, the first number is also significant when comparing numbers that are identical but in a different order, like a 32 Life Path compared to a 23 Life Path, both 5 Life Paths with slight differences. 





For example, in general, **20**, **29 **& **38** are all **11** Life Path numbers with the same qualities of an **11**, but a **29** is a more feminine **11**, ** **compared to a **38**, which is a more social and business-minded **11**. **20** is probably the most feminine and secretive **11 **\(feminine because of the 2 and secretive because of the 0\). Also your Life Path indicates the age you'll have a turning point in life. 

20 

29 

38 

2\+0 = hidden **11** \(0=9\)

2\+9 = **11**

3\+8 = **11** 

**2** = feminine, diplomatic, **2** = feminine, diplomatic **3** = social, creative 

**0** = **9** qualities, **0** hides 

**9** = introverted, artistic, 

**8** = business-minded, 

true nature of the **2 **& **11** 

adaptive, egotistical 

powerful, materialistic

energy

**11** = athletic, intuitive, 

**11** = athletic, intuitive, 

**11** = athletic, intuitive,

Notice the difference between words \(seen below\) by looking at their sum total in Gematria. All the words below equal to 9 but are different types of 9 energy: Dick = **1**8

Penis = **2**7

Pussy = **1**9

Vagina = **2**7

**1** = Aggressive Energy

**2** = Feminine Energy 

**Same Types of Energy **



Your Life Path number, Day Number and your Chinese astrology sign number \(sign number or Gematria number or Letterology first letter number\) can indicate people, places, things, years, days, months, etc. you will benefit from whenever or wherever your true \(before being reduced\): Life Path number, Day Number or Chinese astrology sign \(sign number, Gematria number or Letterology first letter number\) appears. 



For example, 23 Life Paths or someone born on the 23rd of any month should have an overall good year in 20**23** because the 23 \(23rd year of the 2000’s\) in 20**23 **is aligned with their Day Number or Life Path number. Other 5 

Life Paths such as 32’s, 41’s, etc. or people born on the remaining 5 days \(the 5th and 14th\) will also benefit in 20\(**23**\) because **23** \(2\+3\)=5. Even people born in the year of the dragon \(**32** in Gematria and the 5th sign\), Pig \(**23** in Gematria\), 

~ 27 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

Tiger \(**32** in Gematria\) and Snake \(**32** in Gematria\) will benefit from the year 20\(**23**\), and also in 5 Personal Years, 5 Universal years \(such as 2012\), and years whose digit\(s\) have a 5 at the end or equal to 5 \(such as **2003**, 199**5**, ** **200**5**, 20**14**, 201**5**, 20**32**, etc.\) unless other energies prevents this, such as enemy years in Chinese astrology or Enemy Personal Years in numerology occurring in the same year. ** **

Example - People That Will Have a Good** **Year in 20**23**:

• 5 Life Paths

• People Born on the 5th, 14th and 23rd

• Dragons \(5th Sign\) Also Dragon = 32 \(Gematria\)

• Tiger = 32 \(Gematria\)

• Snake = 32 \(Gematria\)

• Pig = 23 \(Gematria\)** **

Also, compatible energies will also benefit from years with 5 energy such as 11 Life Paths and people born on the 11th, 20th \(hidden 11\) and 29th \(because 5 and 11 are soulmates\) or 7 Life Paths and people born on the 7th, 16th and 25th, because 7 and 11 are soulmates \(in a way\). 



The bottom line is, your Life Path number, the day you're born on \(Day Number\) and Chinese astrology sign \(sign number or Gematria number\) can indicate people, places, things, years, days, months, etc. you will benefit from. 

**Attitude Number **



Your attitude number reveals how you come off or appear to others. It’s how you act or had to become but not necessarily how you feel. It’s what works best to achieve what you want. This sometimes attracts people who aren’t compatible with you. This number is also your extra gifts and talents. This same method of calculation can reveal the hidden energy of a calendar day also. 

Calculate your attitude number by adding your birth month and Day Number together, one digit at a time, then reducing it to a single digit. 

Ex. a - **October 1st** \(10/1\)

1\+0\+1 = **2 Attitude Number **\(also with hidden 11 energy **1**\+0\+**1**\)** **

**2 **= Number of the Diplomat, Peace, Feminine & Protective Energy

- October 1st - an individual with this birthday will succeed in life by having a more sensitive feminine approach to things even though they’re born on a 1 

day and in a 1 month \(October\) which makes them an aggressive person Ex. b - **December 3rd** \(12/3\)

1\+2\+3 = **6 Attitude Number **with **hidden 33 Energy** 1\+2\(=3\)\+3 = **33 **\(influence\) **6 **= Homeboy, Family Oriented, Nurturer Energy

- December 3rd - while born on a 3 day with childlike characteristics, an individual with this birthday has the power of influence & will succeed in life by being more at service to others \(nurturer\) and being closer with their family

~ 28 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Attitude Number: Master Number Energy **



There is a difference between October 1st \(10/1\) and January 1st \(1/1\). 

In general, when adding numbers and you come across 1 & 1, 2 & 2 or 3 & 3 

beside each other in any date or any set of numbers, it means master number energy \(11, 22 or 33\) is present. 

Ex. a - **January 1st** \(1/1\) = 11

1\+1 = **11 Attitude Number **\(master numbers aren’t reduced\)** **

**11 **= Emotional, Visionary, Psychic, Intuitive Energy Ex. b - **January 11th** \(1/11\) = 3

**11**\+1 =12 \(1\+2\) = **3 Attitude Number **\(Social, Comedic, Childlike\) Ex. c - **February 2nd** \(2/2\) = 22

2\+2 = **22 Attitude Number **\(master numbers aren’t reduced\)** **

**22 **= Builder/Destroyer, Manifesting Energy

Ex. d - **March 3rd** \(3/3\) = 33

3\+3 = **33 Attitude Number **\(master numbers aren’t reduced\)** **

**33 **= Master Teacher/Influencer, Enlightened Energy **Streets, Names and Addresses **

Home and business addresses have energy that can be calculated by adding up just the numbers in the address from left to right, one digit at a time, then reducing it to a single digit. Apartment numbers, room numbers, etc. are added separately and are a separate partial energy as the actual address is the main energy. Home addresses that reduce to 6 \(home and family\) are best. 

Never own or live in a house that reduces to 11 \(a very emotional place\). Also, never own a business that deals in physical activity such as a car repair shop or gym, that has an address that reduces to 7 \(injury prone\), many accidents will happen. ** **

Ex. The street address “**1130A** Sesame Lane” \(11\+3\+0\+1=15 \[1\+5\] = 6\) has **6 **energy \(the letter a=1\). **6** **Life Path’s **\(or anything else that reduces to **6 **or is compatible with **6**\) are** **aligned with this address. Avoid people, places & things that reduces to your enemy number\(s\). 



Basically, anything with a name or number has an energy that can be calculated, even writing numbers or letters on things will imprint energy. In all, the names of cities, states, countries, streets, people, etc., can be calculated two different ways. The first method \(Letterology\) is identifying the first letter in the name and the number value of that letter \(ex. a=1\), revealing its energy. 



The second method \(Gematria\) is done by adding up the number values of each letter in the name together, from left to right, one digit at a time, then reducing it to a single digit, revealing its energy. For example, the street ”Martin Luther King Jr Dr” \(as it’s spelled\) = 115 \(11\+5\) =16 1\+6 = 7. 

~ 29 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33



**Hidden Energy **



Basic number energy \(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\) and master number energy \(11, 22, 33\) can be hidden in any set of numbers \(including dates, birthdates, etc\). 

Ex-A: the date **3/12/2022** has hidden **22** and **33** energy

• 3 1**2 2**0**22 **—** **3-1\(**2**-**2**\)0\(**22**\) = hidden **22 **energy

• **3 12 **2022 — 3\+\(1\+2\) = hidden **33 **energy

Ex-B: the number **1119** has hidden **11** and **19** \(1\) energy

• \(**11**\)19 = hidden **11** energy. 

• 1\(**11**\)9 = hidden **11** energy. 

• 11\(**19**\) = hidden **19** energy \(19 is the number of sickness & bad karma\) Ex-C: the name “**Tupac**” has hidden **13**, **11 **and **22** energy **T u p a c**

20 21 16 1

3

• \(**20**\) 2\(**1** **1**\)6 1 3 = twi hidden **11** energies \(20 = 11\) 

• \(**2**0 **2**\)1 16 1 3 = hidden **22** energy

• 20 21 16 \(**1 3**\) = hidden **13** energy \(number of the matrix itself\) **Hidden Energy: Calendar Days **



Adding from left to right is important because the first or 2nd number compared to the third number in an equation could determine if there is master number energy present \(11, 22 or 33\). For example, there are 365 days in a year \(366 during the leap years\). Each calendar day has a hidden energy that is based off of its number position. 

August 1st is the **213th** day of the year \(see chart on next page\): *On the surface 213 reduces to 6 *

2

1 3

2 \+ 1 \+ 3 = 6

*But when you take a closer look *

2

1 3

\(2\+1\)

\! 

= **3** \+ **3 **= 33 \(Master Numbers are never reduced.\)

~ 30 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

Hidden Energy: Reduce the Number Position of a Day to a Single Digit. Ex 1 - Feb 2nd Has 33 Energy. 

Ex 2 - May 3rd \(the 123rd Day of the Year\) Has 33 Energy: 1\+2\(=3\) \+3 = 33, Therefore \(1\+2\)\+3 = 33** **

~ 31 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Universal and Calendar Days **



Every day consists of both universal energy and calendar energy existing at the same time. The universal energy of the day is calculated by adding up the current date from left to right one digit at a time, unless it’s a **11**, ** 22 **or **33 **\(never reduce master numbers\), then reducing it to a single digit by adding the remaining numbers together unless it’s a master number. Calendar day energy is calculated by reducing the calendar day to a single digit \(if not already\). The 2nd of the month is the only time a “2 day” occurs. The 20th is a 11 calendar day. 

Side-note: The first universal day of a new year imprints an energy for that entire year also. For example, 1/1/2023 \(1\+1\+2\+0\+2\+3\) = 9 = a year full of endings.

**4/7 day** - you’ll see more police than normal, it’s not a good idea to break the law this day as you’re more likely to get caught when dealing with 4 energy \(law & order\). Wearing blue will help minimize trouble. With 7 being the number of injury it’s not a good idea to go to the gym or do any major physical activity on 7 days because the body is weaker but it is great day to research & learn new things, 7 is the number of the genius. 

Side Note: Going against the energy of the day can cause problems. For example, not wanting to answer simple questions on a 3 day \(Communication\) or not staying at home on a 6 day \(Home & Family\). It’s best to follow the energy of each day. Addresses you visit and the Life Paths of people you deal with should align with the energy of the day. 

~ 32 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**1 DAY **- All about new beginnings, taking action, being aggressive. Great day to start new things: signing contracts, business, company, marriage, relationship, a family, buying a new car or house, starting a new routine, etc. Anything started on this day has great potential. People you meet for the first time on this day could be a good start of something new \(relationship/partnership/situationship\). 

Good day to hit the gym, high chance for arguments, disputes, fights and road rage. Expect people or yourself to be very aggressive today. Also, being aggressive today will get you ahead. Follow the energy and visit addresses that reduce to 1 or associate with a 1 Life Path today. 

**2 DAY **- This day only occurs on the 2nd day of each month and is a good day to make peace with people you have a problem with and end the beef \(2 is feminine, diplomatic energy\). Avoid doing so if the 2nd falls on an 11 universal day \(it's not possible\) because 11 is the continuation of war. Not a day to fight or attempt any type of violence, as violence fails under 2 energy. People you meet for the first time on this day could introduce peace into your life. A day to have a sensitive approach and see things from both sides. 

**3 DAY **- The least stressful day, great day for all forms of communication \(emails, text msgs, phone calls, etc.\), great day to promote a product, project, etc., great day to be social, public speaking, networking, etc., 3 is the number of communication, the child and the comedian - making this day filled with playful energy. Create a social media account today that you want to be popular and also post the first post on a 3 day as well \(what is imprinted first is forever like a birthday\). Also, People you meet for the first time on this day could be beneficial to your social status or business in someway. Follow the energy and visit addresses that reduce to 3 or associate with a 3 Life Path today. 

**4 DAY **- All work no play type of day, a day to put in hard work. Start a new routine and introduce some structure to your life, a day to watch for police - they will be in places least expected. Do not break the law as you have a higher chance of going to jail or getting in trouble, because 4 is the number of law and order. You could be baited into situations that will end with the law being called, so try to avoid these situations. People you meet for the first time on this day could introduce structure into your life. Wearing blue on this day or to court will decrease trouble. A good day to deal with all things involving 4 energy such as filing a lawsuit or other dealings with the law, visiting addresses that reduce to 4, dealing with people who are 4 Life Paths. 

**5 DAY **- Best day for traveling and having sex. 5 is the number of beauty, change, good luck, health and sex, people will be more sexual today, Good day to throw a party, get together or event. Good day to try to make a child \(especially if you have trouble having kids\). Good day to start anything new such as a business if you're a 5 Life Path or your Life Path is compatible with the 5 

because 5 sucks the wealth out of 4 \(the matrix itself\) and 4 is the number of wealth. Not a good day to be a hermit and stay home. Not a day to start a war you don’t expect to finish with someone \(5 is the number of war\). Follow the energy of the day and visit places with addresses that reduce to 5 or be in the company of people with 5 energy \(5 Life Paths\). ** **

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**6 DAY **- All about home and family - a good day to stay home or be around your family \(family cook outs or gatherings included\), spending time with your family and love ones in general. A good day to cook and eat at home. All things involving your home: shopping for your home, cleaning or reorganizing your house is also favored today. Things concerning your home could come at the center of attention today such as needing something repaired. A good day to fix broken relationships with your loved ones - call a family member today as the energy calls for it. A good day to move or relocate to a new place to stay. Follow the energy and visit addresses that reduce to 6 or associate with a 6 Life Path today. 

**7 DAY **- A day that’s best spent alone \(being around people could cause problems\), a day to research and learn new things, a good day to teach a class 

— today your mind is stronger than your physical body, 7 is the number of intelligence and technology. 7 is also the number of injury \(and illness\) — 

shootings/stabbings and all types of injuries are more likely today, don’t go to the gym or do any hard physical activities today, All types of accidents are more likely today such as car accidents. Not a good day to go to the hospital - injury energy could cause doctors or nurses to make mistakes when operating on you or treating you. People you meet for the first time today might not last long as 7 

is anti-relationship energy - don’t expect to meet your soulmate on this day. Do NOT get married or start a relationship during any 7 year, 7 universal days or on the 7th, 16th or 25th of any month. Any relationship started under 7 energy \(or 9 

energy\) will fail. Follow the energy of the day and visit addresses that reduce to 7 

or associate with a 7 Life Path today. 

**8 DAY **- Money, power & karma day. A good day to make money moves, start a business, open a bank account, sign a contract that you expect to make money from, place bets, be materialistic: buy cars, houses, stocks, etc. or even go to locations that reduce to a 8 or associate with a 8 Life Path. Not a good day to create bad karma as it can backfire almost instantly. People you meet for the first time on this day can be a bringer of good or bad: money, power, karma situations or a karmic relationship. Expect people to feel empowered today \(controlling/abusing their power\). Good day to start something new that you want to be successful \(money wise\) such as a business but only if you are either a 8 Life Path or your Life Path or Day Number is compatible with the 8. also, a good day to create a social media account you want to be make money and be sure to post your first post on a 8 day or whatever “month number” is compatible with your Life Path \(what is imprinted first is forever like a birthday\). If your Life Path is enemies with the 8 other options are available like a 28 day \(wealth\) or 5 day because 5 sucks the wealth out of 4 \(wealth\) - for example a 7 

Life Path could use 5 days to its advantage because 5 and 7 are friends. 

**9 DAY **- This day is about endings, finishing things up and bringing things to completion. Good day to finish things \(in general\) or things you have been putting off or meaning to finish, running errands, etc., Good day to end a relationship, partnership or agreement/arrangement. A day to cut negative people off/end a relationship, end bad habits, old routines, etc. \(9=Endings\). 

Don’t start a company/relationship or make big purchases on this day. Don’t gamble \(no bets, lottery etc.\). A day people will be egotistical. A day to check 

~ 34 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

your own Ego. Arguments, fights or disputes started from egos clashing are more likely. People you meet for the first time today are mostly temporary or have come into your life to help end a cycle of some sort. Follow the energy of the day and visit addresses that reduce to 9 or associate with a 9 Life Path today - even a 11 Life Path will have more luck getting alone with a 9 today. 

**11 DAY **- an highly emotional day, 11 is highly emotional energy. Expect people or yourself to be very emotional on this day. This is definitely a day to control your emotions. High chance of fights, disputes or road rage. Expressing your emotions is favored today, just don’t let them take over or control your day. A higher chance of killing or hurting someone if you let your emotions get the best of you today. Not a day to try to end a dispute with someone who is always emotional, some people will be too emotional to compromise - plus 11 is the continuation of war. Extremely powerful day to release & get people emotionally involved in a project. A good day to hit the gym/workout and release emotional energy. Also, taking a shower will help release emotional energy because water holds emotion. Good day to do things that involve emotion such as recording music. People you meet for the first time on this day could change your whole outlook on life or they could help spiritually guide you in someway. Technology Malfunctions on 11 days - not a good day to go to the hospital \(because machines could malfunction during surgery or in general\), not a day to fly an airplane. Car problems are possible. Follow the energy and visit addresses that reduce to 11 or associate with a 11 Life Path today. 

**22 DAY **- An extremely powerful day to go super hard, manifest and move forward with putting major plans into action. A day to build or destroy: good or bad, the choice is yours. Violent situations are possible: expect people or yourself to be violent or full of rage. The matrix tests you more on these days. 

Also, 22 has partial 4 energy, so do not break the law. Watch for the police, they will be in places you least expected. You could be baited into situations that will end with the law being called, so try to avoid these situations. Wearing blue on this day or to court will decrease trouble. Start a new routine and introduce structure to your life. Follow the energy of the day and visit addresses that reduce to 22 or 4, associate with a 22 or 4 Life Paths today. People you meet for the first time on this day could help build and take your dreams to the next level. 

Also, people you meet for the first time on this day could help destroy everything you have already built. 

**33 DAY **- An Extremely powerful day for teaching, public speaking, promoting, using your Influence \(power to change someone's opinion or views\), getting people interested in your company, brand, ideas, etc. Expect people to be egotistical or ego driven today. 33 days also have partial 6 energy \(home & family\): All about home and family - a good day to stay home, call or be around your family \(family cook outs or gatherings included\) and/or spending time with your love ones. Shopping for home, cleaning or reorganizing your house is favored today, also a good day to fix broken relationships with your loved ones. 

A good day to move or relocate to a new place to stay. People you meet for the first time on this day could help influence your life in a positive or negative way. 

Follow the energy of the day and visit addresses that reduce to 33 or 6, associate with a 33 Life Path or 6 Life Path today.

**Friendly Days **



Days that are aligned with your Life Path and Day Number are beneficial. Sticking to your own energy \(Life Path & Day Number\) and numbers that are compatible with your Life Path and Day Number is best. For example, if you are a 7 Life Path \(the number with the most enemies\), you will benefit from doing things under 7 energy \(except relationships\) & your Day Numbers energy. 

Ex: **7 vs 4**

Even though 7 and 4 are enemies, a 7 Life Path born on the 4th could do things on 7 days, 4 days or 8 days \(4 and 8 are soulmates\). 



Avoid doing things under energy that goes against the very thing that you are trying to do. Such as, starting a business on a 8 universal day that happens to fall on the 9th \(9 energy\). 9 is the number of endings and partnerships and a business started on this energy will fail. So regardless, it’s best to play it safe and avoid doing things that go against the energy of the day \(unless it's your energy for the most part\). Wouldn’t recommend a 9 Life Path signing a contract on a 9 day either. 

**Enemy Days **



Each Life Path number and Day Number has enemy number\(s\). All people, places and things should be avoided whenever and wherever your enemy numbers are present \(especially your Life Path’s enemy numbers\). 



Keep in mind that your Life Path number, your Day Number and the number\(s\) they are enemies with, when planning or making major plans on certain days, months or years. Don’t start any major plans in your enemy years, months or days. When planning things, avoid dates with enemy energy. find better days, months and years that don’t have enemy energy attached to it. 

Examples Below:

**5 vs 8 **

5 and 8 are enemies. A 5 Life Path that wants to start a business or sign a contract they expect to make money from, should do it on a 5 

day, 1 day \(new beginnings\) and a 4 day \(because 5 sucks the wealth out of 4\), instead of doing so on a 8 day or under 8 energy period \(unless they happen to be a 5 Life Path born on the 8th or vice versa\). 

**11 vs 1** 

An 11 Life Path shouldn’t start or do anything major on a 1 day because 1 and 11 are enemies. A 5 day would be beneficial or even an 11 day \(because sticking to your own energy is usually best\). 

**11 with 1 Energy vs 1** 

An 11 Life Path who is born on the 28th can still use the number 28/1 

energy, even though 11 and 1 are enemies, because they have 28 

energy, just like they have 11 energy.

Directions: Add the current month \+ **1** \+ current year to determine the Universal Days for that month. 

For example, to determine the days for July 2022: 7\+**1**\+2\+0\+22=32 \(3\+2\) = **5. **The Universal days for July 2022 falls under the column starting with 5 Side Note: For 22 days or 33 days use columns 4 or 6.

**Universal and Calendar Months** 



Each month has both universal energy and calendar energy existing at the same time. These two energies both determine the overall theme and what to expect of each month. The calendar energy of a month stays the same every year, while the universal energy of each month is different each year. 





For example, one should be extra careful when it comes to the police and breaking the law in a 4 Universal Month and the month of April \(4th Calendar Month\), because 4 is the number of law and order. 



Calculate the universal energy of the month by adding the current month with the current year together, from left to right, one digit at a time, then reduce it to a single digit unless it’s a master number **11**, **22 **or **33 **\(never reduce master numbers\). Calculate calendar month’s energy by reducing it to a single digit. 

Ex. **June** of **2023** is a **4 Universal Month** with **6 Calendar Energy** 6\+2\+0\+2\+3 = 13 \(1\+3\) = **4 Universal Month**

June \(6th month\)** **= **6 Calendar Month **

Side-note: All of the calendar and universal energy for the months of January \(**1**\) and October \(1\+0=**1**\) are always identical. For example, Jan. 1, 2023 \(1/1/2023\) and Oct. 1, 2023 

\(10/1/2023\) are both **9** universal days, in **8** Universal Months. The same applies for the months of March \(**3**\) and December \(1\+2=**3**\). 

**First Day Imprint **

Technically** **each month carries three different energies when you factor in the universal energy of the first day of a month along with the other two energies \(universal and calendar energy\). All three energies help determine the overall energy of the month. The first universal day that a month is started on is important because, with energy, it’s all about what came first \(whether we’re talking numerology or astrology\). Keep in mind, the energy of the current universal \(calendar\) year, your personal year, the Chinese year, etc. are all also present because all energies exist at the same time. 

Ex. Energy for the month of September 2023: 

A. Month started on a **8 Universal Day** \(9/1/2023\)

9\+1\+2\+0\+2\+3 = 17 \(1\+7\) = 8

8 = Money/Power/Karma

B. Universal Month: **7 Universal Month** \(9/2023\)

9\+2\+0\+2\+3 = 16 \(1\+6\) = 7

7 = Loner/Learning/Injury

C. Calendar Month: **9th Calendar Month**

9th Calendar Month = 9

9 = Lots of Endings/Completion** **

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Your Birth Month **



The month you are born in has two energies existing at the same time; Universal energy and Calendar energy \(actually three energies when you calculate the universal energy of the first day of your birth month\). Both energies have a great influence on your character and who you are as a person. Refer to the definitions of the numbers & keywords for a better understanding of your birth-month’s energies. 

**Calendar Month Energy **



The calendar energy of your birth month is calculated by the number position of the month you were born in. For example, October, the 10th month \(1\+0=1\) vibrates as a 1, similar to the month of January \(1st month\). December, the 12th month \(1\+2=3\) vibrates as a 3, similar to March \(3rd month\). October \(10th month\) and December \(12th month\) are the only months that have to be reduced to a single digit by adding both digits together to get a single digit. 

November is not reduced because it’s the 11th month and 11 is a master number \(master numbers I never reduced\). \(See chart below\) *Example* —

An individual born in December: 12th month \(1\+2\) = 3 Calendar Month** **

3 Calendar Month = The Child/Comedian/Creative/Social/Communicative **Universal Month Energy **



The universal energy of your birth month is calculated by adding your birth month with your birth year, from left to right, one digit at a time, then reducing the total to a single digit \(unless its a master number 11, 22 or 33 

because master numbers are never reduced\). 

*Example* —

An individual born - March 13, 1987** **= 1 Universal Month 1 Universal Month = Aggressive/Masculine/Leader/Will Power/Argumentative

~ 60 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Power Month **



Although, your Life Path number can also determine your good and bad months throughout the year, the number of your birth month and its soulmate number can indicate your best month of the year \(power month\). This method can also determine months with friendly energy \(long as those months are not your enemy in Chinese astrology\). Your Power month \(and people born in it\) is very beneficial for any major plans you plan on being successful, whether its getting married, starting a business, releasing a project, etc. 



For example, if you're born in August \(8\), your power month is the month of April \(4\) because 8 and 4 are soulmates. If your born in March \(3\), your power month is March \(3\) because 3 loves its OWN energy. Another example, if you were born in July \(7\), your power month is November \(11\), because 11 is like a soulmate to 7. But if you were born in May \(5th month\), the month of November \(11th month\) wouldn’t be your power month, it would actually be your enemy month \(in Chinese astrology\), because May is the month of the Snake and November is the month of the Pig, Snake and Pig are enemy signs in Chinese astrology, but the affects of this are lessened because 5 and 11 are soulmates in numerology. In this case, May \(because its your own energy\) and April \(4\) would be your power month\(s\) because 5 sucks the wealth out of 4. 

Note: Whenever you have energies that, on one hand, is your enemy in numerology, but in astrology, it is friend or soulmate energy \(or vice versa\), then the affects of enemy energy are lessened but keep in mind this is enemy energy and should still be avoided at all costs whether it’s in astrology or numerology. 

~ 61 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33



**Enemy Months **



Although, your Life Path number can also determine your enemy months \(by its enemy number\), Enemy months are also based off your birth month’s calendar number and the number\(s\) it is enemies with \(seen below\). If your Life Path number is the same as your enemy month or is soulmates or friends with the number of your enemy month then the affects of enemy energy are lessened. Be sure to check your enemy months In Chinese astrology as well. If your enemy month in astrology is your friend month in numerology then the affects of enemy energy is lessened. Also, People born in July \(7\) worst of enemy months will be in June \(6\) because 6 is 7’s worst enemy, unless your Life Path is compatible with 6 or your Chinese zodiac sign is compatible with the Horse \(" Month: Jun 6 - Jul 5\), then the affects of enemy energy are lessened. 

• Don’t Start a Relationship or Get Married in Your Enemy Month

• Don’t Start a Relationship With People Who Are Born in Your Enemy Month

• Don’t Get Married or Start a Relationship With People Who Are in Their Enemy Month \(Regardless of Your Compatibility\) 

• Don’t Start a Relationship With People You First Met in Your Enemy Month: Even if Your Enemy Month Has Passed

• Don’t Have a Child in Your Enemy Month

• Don’t Start a Business in Your Enemy Month

• Don’t Buy a Car in Your Enemy Month

• Don’t Buy a House in Your Enemy Month

• During Your Enemy Month\(s\) It’s Best To Lay Low, Don't Take any Risks, Stay Under the Radar and Not Start Anything Major or New \(Including New Jobs\)

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Birth Year Number **



The year you're born in describes your character and determines the type of experiences you will have throughout your life which will also help you find your “niche“ or the thing you're good at doing. Your birth year number is an energy you are born with that is similar to your Life Path and Day Number. 

Though your Life Path and Day Number are more important, your birth year number is one of the next in line along with your birth month numbers \(universal and calendar\). Your birth year number or last digit in birth year can be compatible with another individual’s birth year number \(or last digit in birth year\), Life Path Number, Day Number, Birth Month Numbers and more. 



Calculate your Birth Year number by adding up the numbers in your birth year, from left to right, one digit at the time, then reducing the total to a single digit unless it’s a master number 11, 22 or 33 \(master numbers never reduced\). 

Refer to the definitions of the numbers after calculating your Birth Year number for a better understanding of this energy. 

*Example* — an individual born in the year 1980

**9 **= Good Leader/Good Follower, Artistic, Makes Others a Better Version of Themselves, Egotistical \(Problems With Ego\), Possible Problems With Addiction, Being Put in Situations Where You Are Forced To Adapt. 

**Birth Year Number: the Last Digit **





The very last digit in your birth year reveals more about your personality. 

For example, people whose last digit in their birth year is 3 \(1973, 1983, 1993, etc.\) are very creative, social/friendly people who are good at all forms of communicating \(speaking, writing, poetry, music lyrics or good with words in general, because 3 is the number of creativity and communication. 



The last digit of your birth year also tells you about your childhood and upbringing. For example, someone with a birth year that ends with a 5 \(2005, 1995, 1985, etc.\) most likely moved a lot and did a lot of traveling when they were younger or, on the negative side, might have been introduced to sex at an early age because 5 is the number of sex and travel. The last digit in your birth year can also be compatible with the last digit in another individual’s birth year, birth year number, Life Path Number, Day Number, Birth Month Numbers and more, because this number is apart of your energy. 



If the last digit in your birth year is a 0 you have 9 characteristics because 0 is the hidden 9, but the qualities of the number it’s beside are also enhanced or amplified, but can also be hidden or kept secret. For example, if your birth year is 1970, the qualities of the 7 are enhanced or amplified. Or if you're born in the year 2000, the qualities of the 2 are enhanced or amplified.

**Birth Year/Universal Year Chart **

Your Birth Year Number does good in its own years and years thats are compatible with your birth year number. Beside your Life Path or Chinese Astrology birth year’s sign \(zodiac sign\), other difficult years can be determined by the universal years that are enemies with your Birth Year Number. Also, keep in mind the type of year you are in, for example, 7 years will still be lonely/injury prone, 11 years will still be emotional, 9 years will still be full of endings, etc. 

Birth Year

Good Year

Difficult Year

**1978 \(1\+9\+8\+7\) = 7**

2014 \(2\+0\+1\+4\) = 7

2004 \(2\+0\+0\+4\) = 6

1978 and 2014 are both 7 years

6 and 7 are Enemies

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Personal and Universal Years **



Each year has both personal year energy and universal \(calendar\) energy existing at the same time. These energies determine the overall theme/lessons for the year. Existing concurrently, everyone is under the influence of the current calendar year \(universal year\), while living in their Personal Year. Personal Year cycles start and end on your birthday and are the more dominant energy compared to the energy of a calendar year. The definitions below apply to universal \(calendar\) years as well. 





Calculate your Personal Year by adding your birth month and Day Number with the current year \(or the previous year if your birthday hasn’t passed yet in the current year\) from left to right one digit at a time, then reduce it to a single digit unless it’s a master number **11**, ** 22 **or** 33**. Master numbers are never reduced. 

Ex. If you were born **March 19, **1999 and the current year is **2022**

3\+1\+9\+2\+0\+22 = 37 3\+7 = **1 Personal Year**

2022 2\+0\+22 = 24 2\+4 = **6 Universal Year **\(Calendar Year\) **1 YEAR **- The start of a new 9-year cycle. This year is all about new beginnings, taking action, being aggressive. Great year to start new things: company, marriage, relationships, a family, buying a new house/car, etc.. This is the time to finally start something you have been wanting to for a while but was held back from doing so. Anything started this year has great potential. High possibility for fights, arguments and disputes. Not a year to abuse alcohol, DUI’s are possible. 

People you meet for the first time this year and hit it off with have the potential to be a new friend, business partner or romantic partner, because the time at which new people come into your life reveals the part they will play in your life. 

**11 YEAR **- A year of planning ahead with a vision \(master visionary energy\). A very emotional year, a year to control your emotions, higher chance of disputes, the worst year to take unnecessary risks, people will be emotionally baiting you a lot during this year. A challenging cycle for many, because there are usually a lot of issues going around you, like family conflicts, financial issues and it may not necessarily be you. Car problems or other electronics malfunctioning such as cell phones, computers, etc., this is not the best year to get on an airplane. 

11 will test you emotionally/physically and force you to evolve. The year your whole outlook on life or your life itself will change, most get into or go deeper into occult knowledge. Many people fall in LOVE or get MARRIED in 11 years. A year to start hitting the gym and release emotional energy. Also, taking more showers will help release emotional energy as water holds emotional energy. 

**3 YEAR **- You'll be more social this year, meeting lots of new people, making new friends - not a time to be a hermit. Good year to birth a child. Have safe sex, chances are higher for STDs. Expect to be extremely talkative this year as you are in a cycle of communication. This is the best period of your life to socially network and meet as many high-value people as possible. On the downside, you will be prone to being very sexual, prone to cheating and lazy. This is the best cycle to write, communicate, socialize and the worst cycle of working 

~ 65 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

heavy hours. In order to have a good year, focus on meeting high-value people, cut your hours down because many people quit due to burn out. Most importantly, do not cheat on your partner \(again, there's higher chance of STDs\). 

Be extra careful sleeping around you could end up having an unexpected child. 

**4 YEAR **- All work no play type of year, you could lose many friends. This year is all about working hard, manifesting and building. This year is all about determination and discipline. This is the best year of your life to job hunt, hustle as much as you can and to cut off people that are holding you back in life. You will be way less social and will actually cut out a lot of people that are liabilities in your life. This is also the worst year ever to break the law in any way. You will be more prone to speeding tickets, lawsuits and getting arrested. Do not do anything this year that is remotely criminal.Again, do NOT break the law this year as you have a higher chance of going to jail or getting in trouble. 4 is law & order. 

You could be baited into situations that will end with the law being called, so try to avoid these situations. You will have a great year as long as you are working. 

**5 YEAR **- This year is about change, your life will change more than ever this year, lots of traveling more than ever and having lots of sex. This is the best period for dating and meeting new people. You will have to resist more temptation this year \(even if you’re in a relationship\). You’ll be more indecisive this year \(changing your mind a lot\). You might party more or be invited to more events involving entertainment. Good time to have a child. Higher chance of having a child. Your health is at the center of attention this year - be sure to stay on top of that \(health concerns are possible\). Not a year to be a hermit \(stay at home all day\) or spend a lot of time in the same places, this will causes issues\). 

**6 YEAR **- All about love \(romance\), family, staying home, being responsible, people might throw their responsibilities on you, ask you for money. Your family might need you or ask you for help or you might need your family’s help more than usual. This is the year to fix your relationship and get closer with your family. Your family members could pass away during your year. A good year to buy a house, a great year to move/relocate to a new area to stay \(many people move during this year\), problems with your home could arise, like needing renovations or needing repairs from having mechanical issues. 

**7 YEAR **- The loner year, you will be more alone than usual \(lonely\). Not being alone will cause you more problems this year. The best year of your life to learn as much as possible \(a year full of learning many new things\). Seeking knowledge should be your main priority during this time as you'll learn things you might’ve never knew existed or your level of thinking wasn’t ready for in previous times. This is a time to work on the mind because it will be thinking at a higher level. Expect relationship problems during this time as many people get divorced in this period or break up this year. Do NOT get married or start a relationship this year \(or on the 7th, 16th or 25th of any month or year\). Any relationship started this year or under 7 energy \(7 day, 7 Month, 7 year\) will fail \(also 9 energy days, months & years\). Avoid fights or risky activities as your body will be weaker with a higher chance of getting injured \(injury prone\). Also, this cycle is not great for hanging on to money you have saved as 7 is the most unlucky number. 

~ 66 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**8 YEAR **- Money, power and Karma. All about making moves & handling business, buying cars, houses, etc., the best year of your life to make money. 

You can make more money than you ever have this year \(save it\). You can also lose it all this year depending on your karma. Money could go up and down this year. Try not to spend it as fast as you get it - you’ll be more egotistical and materialistic this year. A year of being blessed out of nowhere \(good karma\) or things from the past coming to haunt you due to bad karma. The consequences of creating bad karma this year can backfire fast. People met this year can be a bringer of good or bad: money, power, karma situations. 

**9 YEAR **- This year is all about endings and finishing things up, ending bad habits, ending old ways of thinking or how you look at things, ending relationships and cutting people out of your life who no longer serve a purpose, ending old partnerships, agreements or arrangements. Whatever you end during this year will NEVER come back. This is NOT a year to start anything new, such as a company, relationship, house, car, etc. it will fail or be short term \(temporary\). Don’t start a relationship, partnership or get married as it will fail. 9 

Years can be stressful as they are getting you ready for a whole new 9 year cycle. This year will force you into taking steps to become the person you are meant to be, finding or deepening your spiritual side. 

**22 YEAR **- A year the universe \(matrix\) will test you the most. An extremely powerful year to work extra hard, manifest & put major plans into action, a year of building or destroying: good or bad the choice is yours. All work no play type of year, you could lose many friends. violent situations are possible. Also, partial 4 year energy is present: All work no play type of year. You could lose many friends. This year is all about working hard, manifesting and building. This year is all about determination and discipline. This is the best year of your life to job hunt, hustle as much as you can and to cut off people that are holding you back in life. You will be way less social and will actually cut out a lot of people that are liabilities in your life. This is also the worst year ever to break the law in any way. 

You will be more prone to speeding tickets, lawsuits and getting arrested. Do not do anything this year that is remotely criminal. Again, do NOT break the law this year as you have a higher chance of going to jail or getting in trouble. 4 is law & order. You could be baited into situations that will end with the law being called, so try to avoid these situations. You will have a great year as long as you are working hard. 

**33 YEAR **- A year where you hold the power of influence, popularity or fame. A year to become enlightened. Partial 6 energy year \(3\+3=6\): All about family, staying home, being responsible, people might throw their responsibilities on you, ask you for money. Your family might need you or ask you for help or you might need your family’s help more than usual. This is the year to fix your relationship and get closer with your family. Your family members could pass away during this year. A good year to buy a house, a great year to move/relocate to a new area to stay \(many people move during this year\), problems with your home could arise like needing renovations or needing repairs from having mechanical issues. ** **

**Energy of Your Age **



Along with your Personal year, Chinese Astrology year, Profection year \(Western Astrology\) and the Universal year, each age you turn also has its own energy for that year. For example, at the ages that reduce to or vibrate at 11 \(age 11, 20, 29, 38, 47, etc.\) your whole outlook on life could change like it does in 11 

Personal Years. Or, for example, 7 = knowledge - you could gain more knowledge than usual at ages that reduce to 7 \(7, 16, 25, 34, 43, etc.\). 



The number of your true Life Path \(before it is reduced\) indicates the age \(or around the age\) you will have a major turning point in your life. For example, if you are a 33 Life Path, then at age 33 you will have a major turning point in your life, or if you are a 25/7 Life Path, then at age 25 you will have a major turning point in your life and also the other ages that reduce to 7 \(7, 16, 34, etc.\) will be significant. 



The number of your age can also indicate the type of people that might come into your life \(temporarily or permanently\). For example, at age 31, a 31/4 

Life Path could come into your life, be beneficial or could play a role in your life and vice versa. Or things could sync up from both ends of two individuals' lives. 

For example, an 11 Life Path at the age of 31 could enter a 31/4 Life Path's life who happens to be in their 11 Personal year in the year 2018 \(2\+0\+1\+8=11\), an 11 Universal Year.

**Calendar Years: First Day Imprint **



Each calendar year carries different energies. All energies are important and help determine the overall energy of the year. The first universal day that a year is started on is one of the most important energies because it's all about what comes first when dealing with energy. 

Ex. - Energy for the** Year of 2023**: 9, 7 Energy

A. 2023 started on a **9 Universal Day** \(1/1/2023\)

1\+1\+2\+0\+2\+3 = 9

9 = Lots of Endings/Completion

B. Universal Year: **7 Universal Year **\(2023\)

2023 \(2\+0\+2\+3\) = 7

7 = Loner/Learning/Injury



This method can also determine things such as how your life will be with cars simply based on the first day \(and also which personal year, universal year and Chinese year\) you bought your first car. For example, if you bought your first car during your enemy year \(in Chinese astrology or Numerology\), then you’ll have trouble with cars more than most people for the rest of your lifetime. 

**Chinese Years: First Day Imprint **



The first universal day \(numerology\) of a Chinese year \(astrology\) will help to determine the energy of that year, because with energy, it's all about what came first \(and **numerology supersedes astrology**\). Keep in mind, the energy of a Chinese year will remain until the Chinese year ends, even if the calendar year ends. For example, the 2023 Year of the Cat doesn’t end until Feb. 

10, 2024 \(Dragon New Year\). 

Ex. - Energy for** 2023 Year of the Cat** 

A. Begins: 1/22/2023** **= **3 Universal Day**

1\+22\+2\+0\+2\+3 = 30 \(3\+0\) = 3** **

3 = Communication/Social

B. Started on the 22nd:** **1/\(**22**\)/2023 = **22 Day** 22 = Master Builder/Destroyer 

C. Universal Year: **7 Universal Year **\(2023\)

2023 \(2\+0\+2\+3\) = 7

7 = Loner/Learning/Injury



This method also reveals all of the energies of the year you were born with. Like in the examples above, someone born in 2023 \(Year of the Cat\), has 3 

energy, 22 energy, 7 energy, and 9 energy \(first universal day on the year imprint\) along with their Life Path, Day Number, birth month number, etc.

**Enemy Years **



Enemy years are based off your Life Path number and the number\(s\) it is enemies with \(seen below\). Enemy years are applied to Personal Years and Calendar Years \(Universal Years\). Personal Years are felt the most in comparison to the calendar year it coexists with. Also, beneficial years are determined by your Life Path’s soulmate and friendly numbers and the actual number of your Life Path. For example, a 11 Life Path doing good in their 11 Personal Year. The same applies to your birth year number compared to the current year, unless your Life Path is enemies with the current year, your life path is the main energy. 

• Don’t Start a Relationship or Get Married in Your Enemy Year

• Don’t Start a Relationship With People Who Are Born in Your Enemy Year

• Don’t Start a Relationship With People You First Met in Your Enemy Year: Even if Your Enemy Year Has Passed, People Who Come in Your Life at the Wrong Time Are Only There for a Temporary Purpose

• Don’t Get Married or Start a Relationship With People Who Are in Their Enemy Year \(Regardless of Your Compatibility\) 

• Don’t Have a Child in Your Enemy Year

• Don’t Start a Business in Your Enemy Year

• Don’t Buy a Car in Your Enemy Year

• Don’t Buy a House in Your Enemy Year

• Don’t Move to a New Place \(Unless Temporary\) in Your Enemy Year

• Stay Away From Cities or States With Life Paths That Enemies With Your Life Path

• During Your Enemy Year It’s Best To Lay Low, Don't Take any Risks, Stay Under the Radar and Not Do or Start Anything Major or New in the Year\(s\) of Your Enemy

**Relationship Compatibility **



The essential match up is when your Life Path aligns with another’s Life Path and/or day of birth, or when your day of birth aligns 

@CASINODOLLAZ

with another’s day of 

birth and/or Life Path. But overall, your Life Path number paired with another individual’s Life Path number is the most important. Your Day Number is the 2nd most important number, then your birth month number and birth year number. 



For example, in both examples below, you’ll see an individual who is a 5 Life Path born on the 7th versus an individual whose a 11 Life Path born on the 7th. Both Life Paths match up and both Day Numbers match up, and, each Life Path matches up with the other individual’s Day Numbers. The 5 Life Path \(Individual A\) is compatible with the 11 Life Path \(Individual B\) because 5 and 11 

are soulmates. The 5 Life Path \(Individual A\) is compatible with Individual B’s Day Number \(7th\), because 5 and 7 are friends. The 11 Life Path \(Individual B\) is compatible with Individual A’s Day Number \(7th\), because 11 is the only number that makes 7 feel whole. Individual A’s Day Number \(7th\) is compatible with Individual B’s Day Number \(7th\) because it is the same energy. You are aligned and attracted to your own energy. This goes for all numbers \(especially 3 

because 3 loves its own energy\). 



Example 1:

**Individual A**

**Individual B**

5 Life Path

11 Life Path

Born on the 7th

Born on the 7th

Example 2:

**Individual A**

**Individual B**

5 Life Path

11 Life Path

Born on the 7th

Born on the 7th





**Soulmate/Enemy Energy **



Individuals whose Life Path & Day Number are both soulmates and enemies to their partners' Life Path & Day Numbers, tend to have a love/hate type relationship. It's best to avoid a person with a Life Path number that is enemies with your Life Path number even if their Day Number is soulmates with your Life Path number \(see example below\). 

Example:

**Individual A**

**Individual B**

11 Life Path

9 Life Path

**9** & **11** = **Enemies**

Born on the 7th

Born on the 11th

**7** & **11** = **Soulmates**

~ 76 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33



The matrix \(Universe\) makes it hard to find your soulmate. The ones that are compatible with you are usually already in relationships with a family of their own, because timing is everything and everyone that’s compatible with you isn’t always meant for you, and yes, people do have more than one soulmate. Also, **numerology supersedes astrology** by far, but enemy energy is never to be ignored, so if your Chinese astrology sign is enemies with another individual’s Chinese astrology sign, then avoid them at all cost, even if all your numbers are compatible or Enemy energy is dangerous and should be avoided at all cost. 

**A Deeper Look **



Your Life Path, day of birth, birth month, universal birth month, birth year \(reduced\) or attitude number can each align \(same energy\) or be compatible with another individual’s Life Path, day of birth, birth month, universal birth month, birth year \(reduced\) or attitude number. But keep in mind that overall, your Life Path number paired with another individual’s Life Path number is the most important. Your Day Number is the 2nd most important number, then your birth month number and birth year number.

Notes: 

• Jay-Z & Beyoncé are both born in the year of the Rooster \(Chinese astrology\), it’s best to only date within your animal trine \(friend trine\)

• Jay-Z & Beyoncé are both 32/5 Life Paths — the same energy

• Both numbers in Jay-Z’s Life Path \(32\) are compatible with the numbers in Beyonce’s Life Path number \(32\)

• Both are born on the 4th — the same energy

• Both are 5 Life Paths born on a 4 day \(4 gives its wealth to 5 because it’s obsessed with 5\). This makes them both obsessed with each other

• Both are born in 28 Universal months \(same energy\) — 28 is a number of wealth

• Jay-Z is Born in the month of the Rat, Beyoncé is born in the month of the Monkey — Monkey & Rat are Friends signs of the same trine 

• Jay-Z’s born in the year of the Rooster, Beyoncé is born two days before the month of the rooster begins, meaning she has characteristics of both the month of the Monkey and the Rooster

• Jay-Z real name \(S\)hawn S=19 \(1\+9\) = 1, \(B\)eyonce - b=2 — 1 & 2 are friends

• Jay-Z comes off as a 7 \(attitude number\) and is born in a 7 year \(1969\) which is compatible with Beyoncé’s Life Path 5 — 5 & 7 are friends

• Beyoncé comes off as a 4 \(attitude number\) which is compatible with Jay-Z’s 5 

Life Path \(4 gives its wealth to 5 because it’s obsessed with 5\)

• 5 is able to seduce wealth out of the number 4

• 5 has a love/hate relationship with the 6, but are secret soulmates

• 6 loves the 3, but the 3 doesn’t always love the 6 back until it loses it

• 6 siphons off energy from the 4 \(4 doesn't mind\)

• 6 is probably 7’s worst enemy

• 7 has no soulmate: in some ways is its own soulmate but 7 also hate’s itself

• 8 is soulmates with 4, but is also a good match with 22 \(partial 4 energy\)

• 11 makes 7 feel whole 11\+7=18=9 is the \# of completion

**Type of Relationships **



The type of relationship and what to expect from it, is determined by two numbers. The first number is calculated by adding both birth years together, one digit at a time, then reducing it to a single digit \(unless its a master number 11, 22 or 33\). The second number is calculated by adding both Life Paths together then reducing it to a single digit. 

***Important note***: This method can be used between any two people to determine the vibe of the relationship, friendship, partnership, etc. This does **NOT**, I repeat does **NOT** determine if two people are compatible or not, again this just determines the TYPE of relationship. \(see example below\) Type of Relationship Example - Jay-Z & Beyonce

**4 Life Stages **



Your life is divided up into four main stages \(or time periods\). The ages at which these four stages occur are different for everyone and are determined by your Life Path number. Every life stage has an underlying energy and is full of life lessons that are calculated by adding the numbers in your birth date together. Each stage is calculated differently using a different method. \(See chart and example below\)

1st Stage - add your ***month** \+ **day*** one digit at a time, then reduce it to a single digit 2nd Stage - add your ***day** \+ **year*** one digit at a time, then reduce it to a single digit 3rd Stage - add your ***1st stage \#** \+ **2nd stage \#***, then reduce it to a single digit 4th Stage - add your ***month \+ year*** one digit at a time, then reduce it to a single digit Example - March 19, 1978

**Adding Lowercase and Capital Letters **



Adding the numerical value of the capital letter, along with the remaining lowercase letters in a word from left to right one digit at a time, then reducing the sum total to a single digit will reveal a hidden energy for that word. Words should be added the way they appear. 



For example, if the word “**MATRIX**” was the name on a building it would have the energy of the 1st and 3rd example \(seen below\) because the lowercase energy is always present. If the word “**M**atrix” was the name on a building it would have the energy of the 1st and 2nd example \(seen below\) because the first letter is capital and rest of the letters are lowercase.

**LETTEROLOGY **



Letterology is the study of relationships between letters and numbers, particularly each letter and its numerical value compared to gematria which focuses on the total sum of each letter in a word added altogether. The first letter in a word is represented by a number that defines the main \(dominant\) energy of that word. Words that start with the same letter have the same energy, also words that have the same letters in them have the same or similar energy. 

**The First Letter **

****



The first letter in a word or name is important because it is the most dominant energy in a word. For example, The letter **M**=**4 **because** **it’s the 13th letter in the alphabet \(1\+3=4\), **4** is the number of law & order and structure, like the** M**ilitary, **M**atrix, **M**aster, **M**afia, **M**ason, **M**ob, **M**ogul. If your name starts with a **M**, it is aligned with all words, names, things and places that start with a **M **

and all people, places and things that has 4 energy \(also **H, Q, Z** words too — 4 

& 8 are soulmates\). Choose a career that starts with the first letter in your name or a career whose first letter is compatible with the first letter in your name. 

**m **i 

l 

i 

t

a

r

y

m = 13 \(1\+3\) = 4 = Structure/Law & Order

**Lowercase/Capital Letter Energy **



Each letter in the alphabet has two numerical values \(lowercase and capital\). In Letterology, the main/dominant energy of a word is defined by the numerical value \(number\) of the first letter in that word. The lowercase numerical value for a letter in a word is always present even if the letter is capital, meaning capital letters carry both lowercase and capital letter energy. 

Example 1

**B**illionaire 

**B**ank 

**B**usiness

b = 2 the Peace/Feminine/Female Energy

B \(Capital Letter\) = 28 = the number of Wealth 

Example 2

**R**ich

r

= 18 = \(1\+8\) = 9 = Adaptive/Egotistical/Illusion

R

\(Capital Letter\) = 44 \(4\+4\) = 8 = Money/Power/Karma

**Examining Each Letter **

**c r a z y ** = 28 \(2\+8\) = 1 = Aggressive/Argumentative 3 18 1 26 25

**c** = 3rd Letter = 3 = Criminal Minded 

**r** = 18th Letter \(1\+8\) = 9 = Egotistical 

**a** = 1st Letter = 1 = Aggressive 

**z** = 26th Letter \(2\+6\) = 8 = Abusive 

**y** = 25th Letter \(2\+5\) = 7 = Psycho

**e v i l**

= 21 \(2\+1\) = 3 = Criminal or Criminal Minded

5 22 9 12

**e** = 5 = War

**v** = 22 = Wicked

**I** = 9 = Egotistical 

**l** 12 \(1\+2\) = 3 = Criminal Minded

**Words Inside Words **



Words that have the same letters in them have the same or similar energy. A word could be perceived one way and also have another meaning hidden inside the word. 

**MODE **

**LO**v**E **

**OVER **

**DEMON **

**LO**s**E**

**Numerology/Gematria Connection: **

The energy of a word in numerology can reflect the actual meaning of the word. 

**8 is the number of Power **

**7 is the number of the Loner **

- Powerful = 44 in Gematria \(4\+4\) = 8

- **One** is found in the word L**one**r

- “**Low**” is found in the word - **One** is found in the word Al**one** P**ow**erfu**L**

- One = 16 \(1\+6\) = 7** **

- 8’s are either High or Low in Life, no - Loner = 28 \(2\+8\) = **1 **

middle ground

- “A l**one**r is al**one**” 

**28 is the number of wealth **

- “Young” = 28 

- “Health is Wealth”

**SHAPES AND SYMBOLS **



There’s energy in shapes and lines, and everything in the universe has a shape. Sharp shapes or straight lines have masculine aggressive energy. 

Smooth circular shapes or circular lines have feminine energy. Shapes with a mixture of both straight and curved lines have characteristics of both. Even buildings and houses are built with straight lines \(aggressive\) for a strong foundation but are decorated with things such as furniture that have curved lines or curved shapes. This knowledge can be applied to logos, letters, symbols, basically anything that has a shape. 



Example 1 — a person with a slim face \(heart or diamond shaped\) and strong jaw “line” comes off more masculine compared to a person with a round face \(feminine\). 





Example 2 — think of the phrase “shaped like a coke bottle” 

referring to a woman's curves \(feminine\). Also, people who are overweight are round shaped, again, curved lines are feminine. 





~ 91 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33





**Shape of Letters: First Letter in Your Name **



Although a person’s Life Path and Day Number play a major part in who an individual is, the first letter \(in this case particularly the shape of the first letter\) in a person’s first name \(middle names and last names too\) are important. 

Similar to Letterology, but instead of the number value of the first letter in a person’s name, it's the shape of the first letter in a person’s name that determines the type of characteristics that person might have. Also, this knowledge can be useful in naming a child, company, team, etc. \(see chart below\)



For example, an individual named “**W**illiam” is a disciplined but also stubborn person compared to an individual named “**S**ean” who is easily distracted with an open mind. William starts with a “W” which is a symbol with straight \(aggressive\) lines, while Sean starts with a “S” which has curvy \(feminine\) lines. 





Vs





**Straight Line - **determined, disciplined, driven, has a strong focus to accomplish their goals, inflexible, stubborn, perfectionist **Curved Line - **open minded, flexible, multitalented, highly creative, needs constant outlet to express themselves, easily distracted 

**Curved-Straight - **balanced, flexible, focused, sees things from both sides, has both “straight line” and “curved line” qualities 





~ 92 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33



**Shapes of Numbers **



Numerology is superior and is at the top of the “food chain” 

\(metaphorically speaking\) when compared to all other forms of astrology because of the simple fact that everything in this universe relates back to numbers. Numbers \(and also the shapes of numbers\) are so powerful that they’re used in everything in life, like, for example, when it comes to measuring time itself, such as the days in a month, months in a year, year in a decade, etc. 

and even the time of the day \(numbers on a clock or watch\). There’s no such thing as a coincidence in this matrix. 



Numbers are symbols that are symbolic for different types of energy. 

Each number has its own energy, and whenever or wherever numbers are found, this is an indication of imprinted energy and that the energy that the numbers \(in question\) represent is present. For example, if you are at a hotel with the address 3002 Sesame Street and the room number is 110, then the energy of that room alone is imprinted with 11 energy \(attracts people like a magnet, emotional energy, etc.\) along with the numbers of the address of that hotel \(3002\) reduced to a single digit’s energy which would be 5 in this example \(3\+0\+0\+2=5\). The 5 energy would be the main energy of the whole building, being that 5 is the energy of the address of the building, but that does not change the fact that the room number \(110\) is imprinted with 11 energy. This means the experience at that hotel in that specific room would be under 5 and 11 energy. 



The shapes of numbers are imprinted with energy and are so powerful that anything resembling the shape of a number will attract that energy is some type of way. For example, drawing the shape of the number 7 on a T-shirt or tattooing the number 7 on your body will attract injury, illness and bad luck, because 7 is the number of injury, illness and bad luck amongst other things. 



Numbers and their shape relate to Numerology’s definitions of each number. For example, 1 is male energy and the leader. Notice how 1 is standing upright and firm. 2 is feminine energy, notice how 2 is kneeling or bowing, 3 is the child, notice 3 is shaped like a baby sitting down. 4 is structured, notice 4 is the only number closed in with sharp angles. 5 is open minded, notice how 5 is open on both sides \(left and right, top and bottom\). 6 is overweight, notice the shape of 6’s bottom half compared to its top half. 7 is the number of injury, 7 is a curve line that comes to a point where it is bent at an angle as if the number was injured. 8 is the number of balance \(equal top and bottom half\). The number of karma \(what goes around comes around\), notice 8 is a never ending loop \(what goes up must come down\) and is the symbol of infinity ♾ . 9 has a big ego. 

Notice the biggest thing is the top half of nine \(the head\). 

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33





**Altering Energy **



The fact that there’s power in the shapes of numbers, if you were to simply write/draw the shape of a specific number beside a set of numbers that's already on a specific object, the energy of the numbers that are on that object would be altered because of the number written beside the set of numbers but not completely because what is imprinted first can never be undone. 





For example, if you own a house with an address that adds to 11 

\(never live in a 11 energy house, very emotional place\), simply drawing a number with a magic marker \(or anything to make your mark visible\) such as the number 6 beside the address, will help to change the energy of that home to a 8 \(money\) to help sell it. Remember what is FIRST imprinted can never be undone, meaning the house will still always have 11 energy alongside the 8. \(see below\) *Example*: 5006 Green St. 

5006 \(5\+0\+0\+6\) = 11

Drawing a 6 beside it will help change the energy

5006**6** \(5\+0\+0\+6\+**6**\) = 17 \(1\+7\) = 8

8 attracts money and will help to sell the house, 





being that its forever imprinted with 11 energy 

**Shapes and Letters: Intertwined **

Below are examples of how numbers and shapes are intertwined in the universe. 

**Snakes** - The letter “**S**” looks like a snake, \(**S**\)nake starts with the letter **S**. 

The letter **S** is the **19**th letter \(19\) in the alphabet. **19** is the number of sickness and bad karma. **S** looks and fits inside the number 8. The number **8** is the number of Karma & Power. Snakes are the bringers of sickness and bad karma, notice when a snake bites, it injects venom \(sickness\) into 

****

****

its victims. Also the snake can form itself into the shape of any number 1-9, people born in the year of the snake \(Chinese astrology\) are wise and powerful. 

**The Number 9** - 9 is the number of Completion. Babies are born and ready to enter the world after 9 months. If you look at the number 9 it looks like a baby in the womb \(9\)





**4 and 7 **- when you tilt a 7, it will fit inside a 4. 4 sucks the energy from 7 and is empowered by it…7 doesn’t mind, but if you are a 7 and do mind, then distance your self from 4’s. An example of this being successful would be a 4 life path launching something to do with knowledge or technology \(7 energy\) on a 7 day. 

**8 and 33 **- If you notice 8 consist of two 3’s \(33\) one is backwards, 33 

is the number of influence. 8’s naturally have POWER and CONTROL 

in situations, which leads to having an INFLUENCE over situations. 33 

****

Life Paths would benefit doing things under 8 energy and vice versa. ** **

**COLOROLOGY **



In Colorology, each color has its own frequency that is determined by what number it adds up to in Gematria. Colors have the power to change the energy and mood of things, including a person's mood. For example, wearing the color orange will give you the power of influence. Or using the colors red, orange , blue or purple for a profile picture will attract people’s attention. It’s best to wear colors that are compatible with your Life Path Number. 

**Green** - the color of wealth. In Gematria “green” = 31 \(3\+1\) = 4, the secret number of wealth, and green is everywhere on Earth from grass, trees, plants etc., part of the reason the USA's currency is green. 

**Blue** - the color of communication and trust. Notice the two most frequently used apps people trust: Facebook and Twitter icons are blue. Blue vibrates as a 4 and a 3 \(with a capital B in gematria\). 4 is the number of Law & Order \(the boys in Blue\), 3 is the number of communication. Wearing blue will help minimize problems with the law \(unless the number 4 

isn’t compatible with your Life Path number\). Blue also kills your appetite. 

**Black** - sucks the energy of everything around it like a vortex. It is all encompassing. So if you wear it, nothing goes in or out. 

**White** - is pure and holds all the other colors. It is reflective and protective. It is enlightening and cleansing. Amplifies your vibration. 

**Red** - promotes willpower and stimulates vitality. Red is associated with anger, violence, energy and sex \(5 is the number of sex\). Red makes people hungry. Red gets people sexually aroused, grabs people’s attention, think Lady in Red from the Matrix. 

**Orange** - the color of influence. Wearing orange will help you influence situations or others. 

**Purple** - the color of deception, attracts people’s attention and is a color of influence \(33\). 

**Gray** - a neutral color, people feel at home and you are not a threat when you wear gray. 

**Adding Colors **





Adding the gematria sum totals of colors together will determine the overall energy of a set of colors that are put together. For example, the colors in the Microsoft logo all add up to 28, the number of wealth \(see example below\). 

This can be used to your advantage depending on what you are trying to attract. 

Example: 





Microsoft’s Logo Colors:

• Red = 9 

Red \(9\) \+Blue \(4\) \+Green \(4\) \+ Yellow \(11\) = 28

• Blue = 4 

9\+4\+4\+11 = 28 

• Green = 4

• Yellow = 11

28 = Wealth \(naturally attracts wealth\)

**CHINESE ASTROLOGY **

verything in the universe has a birth date and is imprinted with energy. 

Energy that is forever and cannot be undone, whether numerology or astrology. Chinese astrology is based off the planet Earth. Using Chinese astrology, the energy of a person, place or thing is determined by the year it was founded in. In other words, people, places or things possess the actual energy of the animal from the Chinese animal year they \(or it\) was born in. 





There are 12 signs in the Chinese zodiac. Each zodiac sign is represented by an animal. Your zodiac animal is determined by the lunar year you were born in, as each animal represents a lunar year \(lunar years don’t start on January 1st\). Each sign has two friend signs and one enemy sign \(except for the Rat and the Ox have each other along with two friend signs, one enemy sign because they’re soulmates\). Sticking to your friend trine \(friendly energy\) will help you to succeed. Though you can learn a lot from your enemy sign given that they are your equal, meaning they are strong in areas where you are weak and vice versa, enemy energy is dangerous and your enemy sign should be avoided at all costs, also, signs that are enemies are usually fatally attracted to each other \(in numerology and astrology\). Signs that are not your friend signs or your enemy sign are considered neutral \(not necessarily an enemy or a friend\). 

Also, your birth month and time of birth both have an enemy month and enemy time that may be different from your actual zodiac animal sign. 





For example, an individual born in 1999, the year of the Cat \(inaccurately known as the Rabbit in Chinese astrology\) would benefit from people, places and things founded under Cat, Goat and Pig energy. People born in the year of the Cat should avoid people, places and things founded under Rooster energy, such as a car like the Dodge Challenger, founded in 1969, the year of the Rooster or even owning a rooster as a pet.

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Chinese Ruling Chart **

\* Each Chinese zodiac animal rules a certain set of years \(see Chinese years chart\), one month and a two hour time period of the day. Your Chinese zodiac sign is based on the Chinese Year you were born in and is the type of Chinese animal you are. The month you're born in is considered to be your Inner Animal \(how you think\) and who you will become later in your life. Also, your Enemy Sign and Friend Signs \(friend trine\) of both your Zodiac sign \(Chinese Year\) and Inner Animal \(Chinese Month\) can be seen on the chart above. 

\* Keep in mind people born a few days \(give or take\) before or after the cusp dates above \(ruling month dates\) can have characteristics of both signs they’re caught between \(especially those born on the cusp or just one or two days before and after\). For example, a person born Jan 7th could still have characteristics of a Rat and have trouble getting along with someone born in the month of the Cat \(Mar 6th To April 5th\), because Rat and Cat will never get along even though they’re not enemies. 

\* Your most Beneficial Months \(Friendly Months\) & Enemy Month are determined by the month and day you were born on \(your Inner Animal\). For example, if you were born on Aug 28th, your Inner Animal is the Monkey \(Aug 6 - Sept 5\) and your Enemy Month is the Tiger \(Feb 4 - 

Mar 5\), your Friendly Months are Month of the Monkey, Rat and Dragon \(see chart above\). 

\* Your Power Time is determined by your time of birth. For example, if you were born 4:28am your Power Time is from 3am-5am \(Tiger\), your Enemy Time is from 3pm-5pm \(Monkey\) and your friendly times are the Horse & Dog times \(see chart above\). During your Enemy Time of day: Be very cautious, Don’t get into any fights or take any risk as it can end badly. 

\* Stay away from people born in your Enemy Month \(and Enemy Time\) regardless of their Animal Sign \(Chinese birth year\) and even if your Enemy Month’s sign is your Animal Sign \(Chinese Year\) or one of your Friend Signs. Apply the same rules from your Enemy Year to your Enemy Month and Enemy Time: Don’t start a business or relationship, don’t buy a car, house, etc. or take any risks during that period. 

\* Avoid people born in the month that is enemies with your Chinese sign \(birth year\). For example if you're born year of the Pig avoid people born in the month of the Snake along with people born in the year of the Snake. Pig and Snake are Enemies.

**Chinese New Years **



The Chinese calendar is based on the lunisolar calendar, which uses elements of the lunar and solar calendar systems. Chinese years usually start and end between January 21st and February 20th, not on January 1st. For example, an individual born January 1, 1968 zodiac sign is the Goat instead of the Monkey, being that the year of the Goat didn’t end until Jan. 30, 1968. If you were born on the cusp or a few days before or after the cusp, you will have energy of both signs near that cusp.

**The 5 Elements **



Although the main characteristics or traits of each animal still remain, there are 5 versions of each zodiac animal: Metal, Water, Wood, Fire and Earth. 

The pairing of one element and one sign occurs every 60 years. The last digit of your birth year reveals your type of animal \(or element\). 



For example, if you were born March 28, 198\(7\) \(after Jan. 29, 1987\) you are considered a “Fire Cat.” If you were born Jan 1, 1988 you're still a “Fire Cat” because the Cat year didn’t end until Feb. 17, 1988. If you're born in Jan. 

or Feb. Chances are you belong to the year before, check when the Chinese new year started for the year in question. 

Side-note: The second to last digit of your birth year defines a part of your personality and human nature also. For example, if you were born in 19\(8\)7 — you also have earth characteristics - \(8\). 

**Metal **- flexible, concentrated, determined, perseverant, reserved, sophisticated, independent, looks out for loved ones, doesn’t ask for others help, enjoys; luxury, comfort and freedom, creates own success, stubborn, demanding, retaliates quick, needs their romantic partner to their follow lead 

**Water** - adaptive, empathetic, sensitive, creative, intuitive, talks a lot, calm, passive, manipulative, gains others trust/affection easily, people follow your lead, makes everyone feel special, influences people thoughts, undecided, always tries to be nice and make everyone happy and this leads to depression

**Wood** - social, active, self confident, dynamic, maintains positive attitude, open minded, professionally organized, excellent friend or colleague, always growing and progressing, marriage and family oriented, gets attached to partner fast, works too much, passive, easily lead

**Fire** - leader, strong person, adventurous, restless, competitive, optimistic, dynamic, enthusiastic, seductive, affectionate, gives all in relationships, inspires others with 

-determined actions, attracts people like a magnet, easily stressed, impatient, quick temper, low tolerance of frustration, right-here right-now type attitude **Earth** - stable, perfectionist, wise, patient, careful, loyal, trustworthy, coordinated, takes responsibilities serious, sacrifices self for others, clear thinker, people come to you for advice, relies on logic rather emotions, controlling, wants to control on destiny, doesn’t 

-trust own intuition, super analyzing of romantic partners but once trust is gained they can rely on you forever

**Friend Years and Enemy Years **



The Chinese year you’re born in indicates what animal trine \(friend trine\) you are apart of and the years that are beneficial \(your good years\) and which years are your enemy years. It’s best to stick to your friend trine for everything. During your enemy years, the energy is totally against you \(very challenging\), so its best to lay low, stay under the radar, don’t take ANY risks or start ANYTHING new, including a new job, new car, new house, new business, new relationship, getting married, having a child, etc. Save these types of plans for your personal years \(your sign\) and friend years \(friend signs\) where you are more likely to succeed and the energy is all for you. If you happen to have a good year during your enemy year, this can indicate that your next personal year \(year in your sign\) will be not so good. Also, years that are not in your friend trine or are not your enemy, are considered neutral.

**Friend Months and Enemy Months **



The Chinese month \(your Inner Animal\) you’re born in indicates what months are beneficial \(friend months\) and which month is your enemy month. 

During your enemy month, the energy is totally against you \(very challenging\), so its best to lay low, stay under the radar, don’t take ANY risks or start ANYTHING 

new. Save all of your major plans for your friend months \(friend trine\) where you are more likely to succeed and the energy is all for you. Also, months that are not in your friend trine or are not your enemy, are considered neutral.

**Birth Year: Friend Months and Enemy Month** The Chinese year you were born in indicates the months that are beneficial and which month is your enemy month \(NOT beneficial\). It’s best to save all of your major plans for your friend months \(and your friend trine years\) where you are more likely to succeed and the energy is all for you \(unless you’re in your enemy year\). It’s best to stick to your friend trine for every thing. Also, months that are not in your friend trine or are not your enemy, are considered neutral. 

*Example* - an individual born in 1999 - Year of the Cat

- The Cat, Goat & Pig are friends signs of the same trine. 

- The Cat and Rooster are enemies.

**Enemy Energy: Birth Year vs Birth Month **



If your birth year is enemies with your Chinese birth month, then you have two enemy months, but the affects of enemy energy for those months are lessened because you possess and are compatible with both energies, making those months complicated for you. In this case, it’s best to do your major plans in the other remaining friend months, especially the months that are friends of your Chinese birth month. Also, you will have more beneficial months being that you are connected to two different friend trines. 

*Example* - an individual born September 28, 1999 \(Cat vs Rooster\) This individual was born in 1999, in the year of the Cat and September 28th, in the month of the Rooster. The Cat, Goat & Pig are friends signs of the same trine, while the Rooster, Snake & Ox are friend signs of the same trine, but the Cat and Rooster are enemies, and this individual has both Cat energy \(birth year\) and Rooster energy \(birth month\). This makes their birth month \(Rooster\) enemies with the month of the Cat \(March 6th to April 5th\), and their birth year \(Cat\) enemies with the month of the Rooster \(September 6th to October 5th\). 

Friendly Months: 

Enemy Months:

**Enemy Energy: Birth Year vs Friend Month **



If your birth year happens to be enemies with one of your friend months then you have two enemy months but the affects of enemy energy for those two months are lessened because you are both friends and enemies with those two months. Overall, enemy energy is never to be ignored. 

*Example* - an individual born May 27, 1979

This individual was born in the year of the Goat \(1979\) and in the month of the Snake \(May 27th\). The Goat and Ox are enemies, and the Snake and Pig are enemies. This means the month of the Ox and the Pig are their enemy months, but the affects of enemy energy for those months are lessened because this individual possesses and are compatible with both energies, making those months complicated for them. In this case, it’s best they do any major plans in the other remaining friend months, especially their birth month and the month\(s\) that are friends to their Chinese birth month \(Rooster and Snake\). Also, they will have more beneficial months altogether being that they are connected to two different friend trines.

**Chinese Sign/Birth Year Compatibility** Your actual Chinese zodiac sign is determined by your year of birth. In relationships/friendships, it’s best to stick to people born in the years of your friend trine and to avoid people born in the years your enemy sign at all cost \(it’s not recommended to date someone in the trine of your enemy either\). Anything that is not your friend or enemy is considered to be neutral. Dating somebody outside your friend trine \(color coded below\) is like an interracial marriage in many ways, but finding somebody within your trine is a lot more important than finding somebody of your race. 

Whats Your Zodiac Sign? 





Chinese Zodiac Compatibility Chart 

~ 122 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Ruling Months/Inner Animal Compatibility** The Chinese birth month you're born is also known as your “Inner Animal”. Your Inner Animal \(Chinese birth month\) is how you think and who you will become more of in your older years. Though it’s best to only date people who are born in the Chinese years that are friends with your Chinese birth year \(your friend trine\), having relationships/friendships with individuals whose Chinese birth month is in the same friend trine as your Chinese birth month is also important, but a relationship/friendship can still work if your Chinese birth year is in the same friend trine as another individual’s Chinese birth year but your Chinese birth month isn’t friends or enemies with the other individuals Chinese birth month, because anything that is not your friend or enemy is considered neutral. In other words, your Chinese birth year is the most important when compared to your birth month. But enemy energy is to be avoided at all cost. 

**Birth Month/Inner Animal Compatibility Chart **





**Friend Trines and Enemy Signs **



The same rules and relationship compatibility that apply to the Chinese zodiac animals \(friend trines and enemy signs\) also apply to the Chinese ruling months. For example, an individual born in the month of the Goat is compatible with individuals born in the month of the Goat, Cat and Pig \(same friend trine\), and should avoid people born in the month \(and the year\) of the Ox because the Goat and the Ox are enemies, and enemy signs are to be avoided at all costs. \(See examples 1 & 2\)

~ 123 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

Example 1: Goat & Pig are friends signs of the trine. 

**Individual A**

Example 2: Goat & Ox are enemies. 

**Individual A**

**Individual B**

**July 26th**

**January 23rd**

Born in a Goat Month

**Year to Month **



Your Chinese birth year can align with another individual’s Chinese birth month and vice versa. For example, an individual born in the year of the Monkey is compatible with someone born in the month of the Monkey or even the month of the Rat or Dragon, because the Monkey, Rat & Dragon are all apart of the same friend trine. Keep in mind that your Chinese birth year sign is the main energy compared to your Chinese birth month, meaning you are more the animal of your birth year compared to your birth month animal. 

Example: Birth year aligned with another’s birth month

**Individual A**

**Individual B**

March 20, **1980**

**August 20**, 1987

Born in a Monkey Year

Born in a Monkey Month

**The Enemy Within **



If your Chinese birth month’s sign is enemies with your Chinese birth year’s sign, then you will have a love/hate type relationship with people born in the month or year that is enemies with your Chinese birth year sign \(enemy sign\). Avoid your enemy sign altogether, even if your birth month’s sign is enemies with your birth year’s sign or your birth month’s sign is compatible with the sign that is enemies with your birth year sign, because you are more the animal of the Chinese year you were born in. 

Example: Pig & Snake are enemies.

**Best If Avoided **



The zodiac signs that are not your friend or enemy are considered neutral, but some signs naturally don’t get along and it’s best if they avoid each other. Avoid individuals that are born in the month\(s\) and years of the animal sign\(s\) that you should avoid \(the best avoid section\), based on the Chinese year and the Chinese month you’re born in. For example, an individual born in the month of the Cat \(or year of the Cat\) should avoid people born in the month of the Rat and the year of the Rat \(and vice versa\) because, even though they are not considered enemies, the Cat and Rat will never get along. 

Example: Cat & Rat are to avoid each other. 

**Individual A**

**Individual B**

**April 1, 1987**

**January 3**, 1986

Born in a Cat Month & Year

Born in a Rat Month

**Complicated **



If your Chinese birth month’s sign is in the “best avoid” section of your Chinese birth year’s sign, then you will have a love/hate type relationship with people born in the month or year of the sign you should avoid. It’s best to still avoid that sign altogether, even if your birth month sign is compatible with the 

“best avoid” sign, that your Chinese birth year’s sign is not compatible with, because you are more the animal of the Chinese year you are born in. 



For example, an individual born December 28, 1987 is born in the year of the Cat \(their actual zodiac sign\), and born in the month of the Rat \(December 6th to January 5th\). The Cat and Rat should avoid each other as they will never get along. Though this individual is born in the month of the Rat, they should still avoid people born in the month of the Rat and the year of the Rat because they are more a Cat \(by birth year\) than a Rat \(by birth month\). if not, this will cause love/hate type relationships \(proceed at your own risk, the choice is yours\). 

Example 1: Born with the same energy that should be avoided. 

**Individual A**

**Individual A**

December 28, **1987**

**December 28**, 1987

**Chinese Inner Animal/Western Zodiac Sign **



There are two types of the same sign when you cross-reference the Chinese astrology ruling months to the Western astrology signs and vice versa. 

For example, an individual born May 24th** **is a *Gemini-Snake*, whereas an individual born June 12th** **is a *Gemini-Horse*. Both are Geminis with different Chinese astrology characteristics: The *Gemini-Snake* is vengeful, the *Gemini-Horse* is stubborn \(see example below\). 

Example - Gemini-Snake vs Gemini-Horse

**Chinese Astrology Supersedes **

****



Your Inner Animal \(Chinese birth month sign\) is more important than your Western astrology zodiac sign. This is because Chinese Astrology supersedes Western Astrology \(side-note: Numerology supersedes all types of astrology\). Sticking to the rules of Chinese astrology will reveal the Western zodiac signs that are your friend or enemy or the Western zodiac signs that should be avoided even if they are not your enemy. Also, as far as relationships or friendships go, keep in mind anything that is not your friend, enemy or in the 

“best avoid” section is considered neutral. 



For example, in Chinese astrology, the Cat and the Rat are not considered enemies but should avoid each other because they will never get along \(relationship/friendship wise\). Meaning individuals born from March 6th to March 20th \(Pisces-Cat month\) and also individuals born from March 21st to April 5th \(Aries-Cat month\) should avoid the Sagittarius's that are born from December 6th to December 21st \(Sagittarius-Rat month\), and also Capricorns that are born from December 22nd to January 5th \(Capricorn-Rat month\). But at the same time, Aries and Pisces, who are born in the month of the Cat \(March 6th to April 5th\), are friends with Sagittarius, who are born from November 22nd to December 5th \(Sagittarius-Pig month\), because Cat and Pig are friends signs of the same trine in Chinese astrology. \(See example below\) **FRIENDS SIGNS**

~ 126 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Chinese Astrology/Western Astrology Equivalent Chart** Important Note: If you are born on the cusp of a sign or within a few days before or after the cusp: you will have characteristics of both signs \(Chinese or Western Astrology\). The cusp is the day a sign starts and the previous sign ends. For example, January 6th is the beginning of the Ox month and the end of the Rat Month. Also, Your Chinese zodiac sign \(who you are\) is determined by your birth year. The Chinese month your born in is your “Inner Animal” 

sign \(how you think\).

**Chinese Astrology: Numerology, Letterology & Gematria** Each Chinese zodiac sign has a different number of frequencies that can be calculated by applying the methods of Numerology, Gematria and Letterology to each sign, and referring to the Numerology definitions of each number frequency. 

**Numerology, Letterology & Gematria Chart **

****

****

****

In Numerology, each Chinese sign’s number order is reduced:

• Rooster = 10th Sign \(1\+0\) = 1 energy = Aggressive/Leader In Gematria, the name of each Chinese sign is reduced to a number:

• Rat = 12 \(1\+2\) = 3 energy = Communication Skills/Creative In Letterology, the first letter of each Chinese sign is reduced to a number:

• Dog: lowercase d = 4 energy = Hardest Worker/Structured

• Dog: Capital D = 30 \(3\+0\) = 3 energy = Communication Skills/Creative **Chinese Sign Compatibility Using Numerology **



There are different methods to determine the number of frequencies at which each of the 12 Chinese zodiac signs vibrate on, such as using the number of each Chinese zodiac sign in Numerology to determine the relationship compatibility between the 12 signs. \(See examples 1 & 2\) For example, the Monkey is the 9th sign, Rooster is the 10th sign, 10 

reduces to 1 \(1\+0=1\) and in Numerology, 1 and 9 are soulmates. Monkey and Rooster are compatible in numerology even though, it’s always best for each sign to stick to their friend trine.

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Founding Dates **



When dealing with energy, it’s all about what comes first. Everything in the universe \(people, places or things\) has a birthdate, and the energy of which a person, place or thing was born in \(or under\) is imprinted forever and cannot be undone. Something as simple as an object like a hairbrush or even a city has its own energy \(in numerology and astrology\) depending on the month, day and year it was made or founded. 



For example, the city of Winston-Salem, North Carolina used to be two separate cities \(Winston and Salem\). Salem, NC was founded on Jan 6, 1766, in the year of the Rooster, and Winston, NC was founded in 1849, also in the year of the Rooster. Although in 1913 \(the year of the Ox\) both cities were made into one city \(Winston-Salem\), Winston-Salem is still imprinted with Rooster energy. People born in the year of the Cat \(and year of the Goat just to be safe\) should avoid this city as much as possible. 



All people, places and things founded in the years of your zodiac sign and your friend signs \(friend trine\) are your type of energy, unless enemy energy in numerology overrides this \(avoid enemy energy at all cost, numerology or astrology\). This friendly energy works in your favor and is the most beneficial. 

You will have more success and feel more at home when dealing with people, places or things founded in your personal year \(your sign\) and the years of your friend signs \(friend trine\). The Rat & Ox are the only soulmate signs on the Chinese zodiac. That being said, an individual born in either the year of the Rat or Ox will benefit from people, places or things founded in the years of their friend signs \(friend trine\) and also people, places or things founded in the years of their soulmates sign. 





Avoid things founded in the years of your enemy sign, because this energy is against you. Enemy energy is dangerous. Some people have gotten killed in their enemy city or died in a vehicle founded in the year of their enemy sign. For example, legendary recording artist Tupac Shakur, born in 1971 \(a Pig year\), got killed in Las Vegas, NV \(a city founded in a Snake year\), riding in a car with Suge Knight, born in 1965 \(a Snake year\). Pig and Snake are enemy signs. 

Tupac had only been signed to Suge Knight’s record label “Death Row” for 11 

months \(before his death\) after being bonded out of prison by Suge Knight \(the Snake\). 





The rest of the remaining signs on the Chinese zodiac that are not apart of your friend trine \(friend signs\) or are your enemy sign, are considered neutral to you. An individual has a better chance with things founded in the year of a neutral sign over their enemy sign any day. Still, it’s always best to stick to your friend trine. Also, avoid people, places or things that are an enemy to the current Chinese year until that year is over.

**WESTERN ASTROLOGY **

he Western astrology zodiac \(popular in Western countries like the United States of America\) consists of 12 signs that are each ruled by a planet. The signs are divided up into four groups of three, which are called the 4 elements: Fire, Earth, Air & Water. Signs that fall under the same element have the same type of overall characteristics and are usually the most compatible with each other. Western astrology is helpful in identifying the similarities and differences between people or giving an idea of why a person might get along better with one individual over another. 



While an individual’s sun sign is based off of what zodiac sign the sun was traveling through on their date of birth, more advanced Western astrology uses birth charts to determine where all of the zodiac signs and planets were at the exact date, time and location of an individual’s birth. On a birth chart, each category of an individual’s life is divided up into 12 houses. Each zodiac sign rules one of the 12 houses and also a certain part of the human body. 



For example, on a birth chart, an individual can have an Aries Sun in the 12th house, Pisces Moon in the 12th house and an Aries Rising sign in the 1st house. Those three placements \(Sun, Moon & Rising\) are known as an individual’s “Big 3” and are considered the most important when it comes to your appearance, personality and mood. In a nutshell, an individual’s whole identity is based off of where the signs, stars, planets and asteroids were located, and also what houses they were positioned in on the day they were born. These placements are imprinted energy that cannot be undone.

**Birth Charts **

What is a birth chart? 



A birth chart calculates the positions of the planets based off the exact date, time and location of your birth. A birth chart is a wheel chart broken up into 12 houses. Each house is ruled by one of the 12 zodiac signs. Going counter-clock wise, each house and sign is made up of 30 degrees, completing a 360 

degree circle. Each house represents different areas of your life, such as your emotions, career, love life, physical appearance, etc. The details of each house are determined by the sign ruling the house. Planets are affected by the energy of the house they’re placed in, and also by which degree.

**Your Sun Sign **



We are not just one sign, but a unique combination of all 12 of the zodiac signs. Most people only know their sun sign because it’s the most popular. Like when it’s Gemini season \(May 21 – June 20\), this means the sun is moving through the 30 degrees of Gemini. Therefore, when someone says they’re a Gemini, they are speaking of their sun sign being in Gemini at the time of their birth. For example, looking at the birth chart example above, the sun was in Gemini at 3° in their 11th house and the Moon was at 13 ° Pisces in their 

~ 179 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33





9th house at the time of their birth, making them a 3° Gemini Sun with a 13° 

Pisces Moon. 

**Transits **



Transits involve a method of interpreting the ongoing movement of the planets. The sign and house a planet is transiting helps identify what type of transit you're having. Whenever a planet is transiting \(moving through\) a sign, check to see which house that sign is in on your birth chart to see what part of your life will be affected, and also to see if you're having a natal return. 



For example, if Mars is currently transiting Virgo at 14° like on the birth chart on page 179, this person is having a natal Mars return in their 3rd house of communication. If Mars \(or any other planet\) is transiting Aries instead, their 10th house \(career, public image and reputation\) will be affected, or let’s say it’s a Full Moon in Leo, this indicates that their 2nd house will be affected \(whichever sign that comes first going counter clockwise is the ruler of that house\) *. *

**The Big 3 **



The term “The Big 3” refers to the Sun, the Moon and the Rising Sign aka the Ascendant \(your social personality\), and are said to be the three most important placements on someone’s chart because it describes a person’s personality, mood and how a person is compatible with others. A person’s Venus sign is just as important too, because it describes how they love others and what type of love. Another important one is Mercury because it describes how a person thinks and communicates. Compare your Big 3 with someone else’s Big 3 to see how compatible you all are. 



For example, being that water signs are most compatible with other water signs \(earth signs also\), someone with a Pisces Mercury in their birth chart might communicate well and understand a person with a Cancer Mercury \(both water signs\) better than a person with a Virgo Mercury \(earth sign\), though water 

& earth signs are compatible: Pisces and Virgo are opposite signs, so far as communication goes their styles would be total opposite. Also, Pisces might have a harder time communicating, being that Mercury \(the planet of communication\) is at its weakest when it is in Pisces.

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Sign Placements in the Houses **

The 12 houses represent different areas in your life. Each of the 12 

zodiac signs rules a different area of your life depending on which house it is placed in on your birth chart. Check your birth chart to see which sign falls into which house. Apply the definitions of the house and zodiac sign to get an understanding of how it affects your life. 



For example, someone with Taurus in their 4th house is stable in their home and family life \(stable household and family support.\) Another example, someone with cancer in their 7th house will find it difficult but will have to face their emotions when it comes to their relationships, partnerships and marriage. 

**Aries **- is where you have new beginnings 

**Taurus **- is where are you are stable

**Gemini **- is where you get objective information from** **

**Cancer **- is where you have to face your emotions** **

**Leo **- is where you are creative and can have fun** **

**Virgo **- is where you have to organize and clean up things** **

**Libra **- is where you have to learn to compromise** **

**Scorpio **- is where you will have endings and transform it into something new** **

**Sagittarius **- is where you gather your wisdom ** **

**Capricorn **- is where you will need patience** **

**Aquarius **- is where you can innovate \(change\) and put your own spin on it** **

**Pisces **- is where magic happens and where you are spiritually protected **Planet Placements in the Houses **



The 12 houses represent different areas in your life. When a planet is placed in a house, the characteristics of that planet add a more detailed description of that area of your life. 





For example, an individual with Pluto in their first house is a powerful and sexual person or, in other words, sex and power are a part of their persona. 

On the negative side, this person could be a bit extreme in terms of power and a pervert. 

**1st House** - becomes part of your persona 

**2nd House** - is made insecure

**3rd House** - is expressed in your communication

**4th House** - is made private

**5th House** - colors your self-expression/creativity **6th House** - needs daily work

**7th House** - is projected onto others

**8th House** - is kept secret

**9th House** - colors your worldview

**10th House** - is made public

**11th House** - will continually improve

**12th House** - is neglected

**Degrees **

Each of the 12 zodiac signs and each of the 12 houses both consist of 30 degrees \(30°\) on the 360° \(360 degree\) zodiac wheel, 30 degrees per house and 30 degrees per sign. Each degree is represented by one of the 12 zodiac signs \(degree chart below\). Planets or other placements \(such as the north node, a.k.a. true node\) placed at a certain degree are defined by the characteristics of the zodiac sign, of which the degree represents. As you get farther away from 0 

degrees, the energy of the sign becomes less and less or more transformed into something different.

Example - The degree at which your ascendant/rising sign is can give a more detailed explanation of how you approach life. In the chart below, the Ascendant \(AC\) is in Gemini at 19° \(19 degrees\). 19° is a Libra degree, meaning this individual takes a balanced approach to life because the sign of Libra is all about balance. If this degree had been an Aries degree \(1°, 13° or 25°\), this person would have had a more aggressive, pioneering approach to life. 

~ 182 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Aries** — 1, 13, 25° 

The Aries degrees relate to the planet Mars. These placements are about being the best \(\#1\), expressing their personal goals and moving their vision forward. 

**Taurus** — 2, 14, 26° 

Taurus degrees are associated with the planet Venus giving these placements an energy of love, abundance, and beauty. Also stubborn. 

**Gemini** — 3, 15, 27°

Mercury rules the Gemini degrees, which focus on expressing curiosity, learning, and communication. 

**Cancer** — 4, 16, 28°

The moon rules Cancer,  giving these placements lots of nurturing and caring energy and an affinity for all things home-related. 

**Leo** — 5, 17, 29°

The Leo degrees relate to the sun and open the placement up to creative personal expression and the enjoyment of life. 

**Virgo** — 6, 18° 

These Virgo degrees denote analytical skills and health in the body thanks to their ruling planet Mercury. 

**Libra** — 7, 19°

Libra degrees focus on “connecting relationally and using the mind to understand the laws of cause and effect,” 

**Scorpio** — 8, 20°

Mars and Pluto are associated with Scorpio degrees and relate to receiving gifts and using creative potency toward higher ideals. 

**Sagittarius** — 9, 21° 

For Sagittarius degrees, travel and higher philosophy are key thanks to their ruling planet Jupiter. 

**Capricorn** — 10, 22° 

Steady work and focusing on long-term goals are essential for Saturn-ruled 

Capricorn degrees. 

**Aquarius** — 11, 23°

These degrees relate to Saturn and Uranus and are about self-expression and ingenuity. 

**Pisces** — 12, 24° 

Pisces degrees, associated with Jupiter and Neptune, deal with all things mystical.

**Critical Degrees **



Some degrees carry more weight in a birth chart. Planets placed at critical degrees \(0°,4°,8°,9°,13°,17°,21°,22°, 26°\) on a birth chart means extra challenges in the house it’s placed in. Depending on which modality your critical degrees fall, you might tend to: over-express \(cardinal\), under-express \(fixed\), or choose a path of ambivalence \(mutable\). For example, 0 degrees in any sign is considered a critical degree due to the karmic nature of it being at the beginning of the sign. 



Quoted from astrology.com *: “If you have a critical degree in your chart, *

*you are more likely to face challenges in that sign until the time comes that you* *transmute that challenge into your greatest strength,” “Once transmuted, critical* *degrees carry a weight of great power and influence.” *

•

• Cardinal Signs: \(Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn\), the critical degrees are 0, 13, and 26. 

• Fixed Signs: \(Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius\), the critical degrees are 8, 9, 21, and 22. 

• Mutable Signs: \(Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces\), the critical degrees are 4 

and 17. 

**0, 13, 26 Degrees** \(Cardinal\)

If you have planets that land in one of the cardinal critical degrees, this means that you’re likely to overexert or overestimate in those areas. For example, if your 

Venus sign \(planet of relationships\) is stationed at 13 degrees Aries in your birth chart, that means you may be overly impatient, risky, or bored in your relationships—and will likely be hard to pin down. Whenever a sign is at 0 

degrees \(or 29 degrees, for that matter\), the sign is working at its fullest potential. 

Any sign placement at 0 degrees is likely to embody all of what that sign stands for. 

**8-9 and 21-22 Degrees** \(Fixed\)

For the fixed degrees, this will likely appear as a shield. Fixed critical degrees give that placement a sense of restriction, restraint, or fear about the possibility of 

‘letting loose. The sense here is that to express or to openly show vulnerability is to be weak or to risk getting hurt. So, you can apply this kind of sentiment to the sign and planet shown in the fixed critical degree. For example, the moon at 9 

degrees Virgo. This person might be so critical of their feelings, and of others, that it might be extremely difficult for them to share. 

**4 and 17 Degrees** \(Mutable\)

With the mutable degrees, these placements do not provide a sense of 

“overdoing” or of “restraint.” Instead, they provide indifference, according to Bristol. This placement has much more trouble taking a hard stance on the energies provided here—whereas the other two placements \(cardinal and fixed\) have more trouble either doing too much or avoiding entirely. An example of this might be if Mars was placed at 4 degrees Cancer. This individual would likely experience great challenges regarding bringing up feelings and how others have affected them.

**The 4 Essential Dignities **

Each planet has a different relationship with each of the 12 zodiac signs. These relationships affect transits and the placements in a birth chart. 



For example, an individual born with Mercury in the sign of Pisces on their birth chart will have trouble communicating in general. Miscommunications and misunderstandings will be highly likely when talking with other people. But on the flip-side, a Pisces Mercury does well with music because music deals w i t h e m o t i o n s a n d P i s c e s i s a n e m o t i o n a l w a t e r s i g n . 





1. **Domicile** - when a planet is positioned in the sign it rules \(more powerful influence\)

2. **Detriment **- is not comfortable in that sign, tends to operate with the least strength

3. **Exaltation** - is where a planet expresses its self best in a sign 4. **Fall** - is a position of weakness concerning the function of the planet

**Zodiac Polarity: Positive Vs Negative** Description of zodiac sign polarity from an article on wellandgood.com

*“Positive signs tend to focus \[energy\] outward and be more self-expressive, while* *negative signs tend to focus their energy inward and be more receptive.” —*

*Rachel Lang, intuitive healer and astrologer *

*“If you have more planets in positive signs, you may need more recognition and* *appreciation for what you offer to the world,” she says. “You could have a* *stronger need to express yourself.” If you have more planets in negative signs,* *on the other hand, Lang says you may be sensitive to the energies of other* *people and prize emotional connection in relationships. “You need to feel heard* *and connected,” she says. *

*Positive signs may also, she adds, be able to process—or at least, brush off—*

*emotional experiences more quickly in order to move on from them expediently,* *whereas negative signs may have a harder time letting go. “You may need more* *time to process emotional experiences, especially if you’ve been hurt,” Lang* *explains. *

**Planetary Returns **



A planetary return is when a planet returns to the same sign and degree it was the day an individual was born, signifying a new cycle or phase in that individual’s life. For example, if you have the Sun in Aries at 11° on your birth chart, the next time the Sun is in Aries at 11° you will be experiencing what is known as your “Solar Return” - this usually occurs around a person’s birthday. 

**SOLAR RETURNS** - When the Sun returns to the same sign and degree it was in on your birth date. This usually** **occurs on an individual’s birthday once every 365 days and the affects lasts for a year \(until your next birthday\). 

**• **This return is all about your energy, self expression, new beginnings & identity. 

**• **The position of all the planets on a solar return chart can tell about the year ahead. Changing your location for your birthday \(solar return\) can change the outcome for the year ahead. \( ***https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/***

***solar-return-chart***\)

**LUNAR RETURNS **- When the Moon returns to the same zodiac sign and degree it was in on the date of an individual’s birth. This happens roughly once a month \(every 27.3 days\) 13 times out of the year. 

**• **This return is all about your mood \(type of emotions\) and how you might react to things. A time to reflect on who you are on the inside. This return brings emotional maturity. 

**SATURN RETURN **- When Saturn returns to the same sign and degree it was in on your birth date. This return happens once every 29.5 years \(3 times in a lifetime on average\) between the ages of 27–31 years old, 56–60 years old and 84–90 

year old. This returned last for about 2 1/2 to 3 years. 

**• **This return is all about karma, challenges, boundaries, self-discipline and being becoming more structured. This return will make and break you, you come out at the other end of it more responsible, stronger, wise and mature because of the hard-learned lessons. 

**MERCURY RETURN **- When Mercury returns to the same sign and degree it was in on your birth date. This happens once a year but doesn’t always happen on the exact day of a person’s birthday. 

**• **This return is all about how you: communicate, your social skills, thought process, how you express yourself and learn new things. 

**VENUS RETURN **- When Venus returns to the same sign and degree it was in on your birthday. 

**• **This return happens once a year and is not likely to happen on the exact day of an individual’s birth. This return affects your finances, love-life \(good 

~ 187 ~

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

or bad\) and also brings new opportunities for new relationships \(friends or romantic partners.\)** **

**MARS RETURN **-** **When Mars returns to the same sign and degree it was in on your birth date. This happens every 1.5 to 2 years and is not likely to happen on the date of an individual’s birth. 

**• **A rebirth of your will power

**• **This return is about your motivation, your passions and managing conflicts. 

• New start and giving you renewed energy in the areas over which it rules **JUPITER RETURN **-** **When Jupiter returns to the same sign and degree it was in on your birth date. This happens every 12 years \(age 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, etc.\) 

**• **Each cycle brings major development, growth, and progress to a person's life. 

• can sometimes involve the breaking down of old structures, beliefs, ideas, and thought patterns, and also the breaking down of relationships, dreams, goals, and values. 

**Planetary Retrogrades: Mercury, Mars & Venus **



When a planet is in retrograde, it changes its motion, appearing to move backwards. Some retrograde periods are longer than others, depending on how far they are from the earth. The normal way a planet affects us changes, almost like a reverse effect or as if the planet is “offline” or in a “sleep state.” 

Retrogrades affect everybody during it’s cycles. 





Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto have retrograde periods, but Mercury, Venus, and Mars are the most felt, most personal, most challenging, and require the most attention and biggest adjustments as they come closer to Earth during their retrograde periods. 

**The Shadow Period **



All retrograde periods have what is called a “*Shadow Period*”, where its affects can still be felt before and after the actual retrograde period. Some shadow periods are longer than others, depending on which planet is in retrograde. For example, when Mercury goes retrograde, its shadow period happens 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the actual retrograde date. 

Sometimes the shadow period can be worse than the actual retrograde period depending on the placements on a person’s birth chart — which sign and/or to which degree the planet is in as it goes retrograde. 

*Side-note: The Sun, Moon and Earth don’t retrograde at all. *

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Mercury Retrograde **



Mercury goes retrograde about 3-4 times a year \(every 4 months\) for a period of around 22 days. During this cycle, the planet mercury forces you to slow down and revisit your past life \(old situations, old patterns, old ways of thinking, old friends, ex-girlfriends/boyfriends, etc.\) only to come out on the other end with a new renewed perspective. Old disputes can also be resolved. 

**What To Expect: **

• All Forms Of Miscommunication/Misunderstandings

• Misunderstandings When Communicating By Saying The Wrong Thing At The Wrong Time - Causing Your Plans To Go Sour. 

• Important Plans Being Delayed Or Not Executed At All

• Expect Delays In Communication, Technology, And Travel \(Traffic Jams, Car Accidents\) 

• All Forms Of Technology, Machinery, Electronics Malfunctioning Or Needing To Be Fixed Or Replaced, Car Trouble: Engine/Electrical Problems, Flat Tires, Locking Keys In Car…..Cellphones, Computer Systems Down, Etc. 

• Reminiscing Of Things From The Past: People, Situations Or Events That Took Place. You May Get The Urge To Contact People You Haven’t Seen In Ages

• Relationships Coming To An End Or Having Problems

• People From The Past \(Even Some From Many Years Ago\) Contacting You

• Old Friends, Ex Girlfriends/Boyfriends Contacting You Out The Blue \(Some Looking For Closure\) Most Are Temporary, The Universe Brings Them Back Some People To Teach You A Lesson Then There Gone Again

• People True Colors \(Feelings\) Being Revealed 

• Expect Sex Life To Be Dry \(Less Sex Or None At All, Especially If Single\) **What To Do: **

• Tie Up Loose Ends

• Double Check All Details As Its Easy To Make Mistakes During This Period

• Create Back Ups Of Files On Your Computer, Phone, Etc. 

• Leave Ahead Of Schedule To Avoid Delays

• Plan Ahead And Be Ready To Reschedule

• Revisit The Pass Or Review Leads You Left Undone Or That Faded Out

• Repair Old Items, Clean Out Your Closet, House, Car, Etc. - Never Know What You Might Find That Was Lost Or Forgotten About

**What Not To Do: **

• Don’t Buy/Lease A Car Or House

• Don’t Make Any Big Purchases \(Wait Until Retrograde Period Is Fully Over\)

• Don’t Sign Any Contracts, Make New Deals Or New Agreements

• Don’t Start A New Job Or Start A New Business

• Don’t Start A Relationship \(Business Or Personal\)

• Don’t Take Back Or Try To Make It Work With An Old Ex - You Will Be Reminded Why Almost Instantly. Things Hardly Work Out Most Of The Time. 

• No Last Minute Road Trips \(Expect Delays Or Wasting Your Time In General\)

**Profection Years **



In astrology, every year of your life is called a “Profection” year. These years start and end on your birthday \(see chart below\). Profection years are filled with lessons that are supposed to help make you a better version of yourself. 

The type of lessons each year will bring is determined by the house \(and the zodiac sign ruling that house\) on your birth-chart. Also, It’s important to know the ruling planet of the zodiac sign that you are having your Profection year in, as you will feel all transits from that planet more strongly during that Profection year. 





For example, Cancer is ruled by the moon, therefore moon transits like eclipses, full moons, etc. will affect you more than usual in a 4th house Profection year if you have Cancer in your 4th house \(on your birth chart\). Also, any planet on your birth chart that is in the same house as the Profection year, transits will also be felt more than usual that year. 



Find which ruling house your age is attached to to determine which Profection year you are currently in \(see chart below\). Definitions for each Profection year on the next page. The definitions of the 12 houses will also give you a more detailed description of each protection year.

**Western Astrology: Numerology, Letterology & Gematria** Each zodiac sign has a different number of frequencies that can be calculated by applying the methods of Numerology, Gematria and Letterology to each sign, and referring to the Numerology definitions of each number frequency. 

****

****

****

In Numerology, each zodiac sign’s number order is reduced:

• Capricorn = 10th Sign \(1\+0\) = 1 energy = Aggressive/Leader In Gematria, the name of each zodiac sign is reduced to a number:

• Gemini \(with Capital G\) = 65 \(6\+5\) = 11 energy = Spiritual Messenger In Letterology, the first letter of each zodiac sign is reduced to a number:

• Aquarius: lowercase a = 1 energy = Aggressive/Leader

• Aquarius: Capital A = 27 \(2\+7\) = 9 energy = Adapter/Performer There are different methods to determine the number of frequencies at which each of the 12 Western zodiac signs vibrate on, such as using the number of each Western zodiac sign in Numerology. For example, Jay-Z and Beyonce both have 9 energy. Jay-Z is a Sagittarius - the 9th sign \(9\) and was also born in 1969 - the 9th year of the 60’s. Beyonce is born in September - the 9th month \(9\). \(See example below\)

@PIGBIBLE or @PIGBIBLE33

**Numerology, Astrology & Spiritual Notes:** 1. Your **2 Main Energies** Are Your Life Path Number and the Day You're Born on \(Day Number\) Reduced to a Single Digit, Unless It's 11 or 22. 

2. Numerology: the **Universal Year** You're Born in Is Just as Important as the Month You're Born In. Metaphorically, the Energy of a Year Is Like the Main Category With Months and Days Under It as Sub Categories. 

3. Don’t Start a **Relationship** or **Friendship** With Someone if:

• Your Life Path Is Enemies With Theirs 

• They’re Born in Your Chinese Enemy Year

• They’re Born in Your Chinese Enemy Month

• They Have More Enemy Energy Placements Than Soulmate or Friend Energy Placements, for Example: Your a **9** Life Path and the Person of Interest Is Born in a **11** Universal Year \(2009\) and Also Born in a **11** 

Calendar Month \(November\) Along With Being Born on an 11 Day \(29th\). 

**9** and **11** Are Enemies, Those **11** Energy Placements Will Make It Difficult To Get Along Even if Your **9** Life Path Is Soulmates or Friends With Their Life Path. 

4. The **Matrix** Makes It Hard To Find Your Soulmate. Your Perfect Match Is Usually Already in a Relationship or Married With Children. 

5. Chinese Astrology: the Chinese Year You Are Born in Is Your Actual Chinese Sign and the Most Important. Then, the Chinese Month You're Born in \(Inner Animal\) Is Your 2nd Most Important Energy. 

6. Chinese Astrology: Avoid People Born in Your Enemy Year or Enemy Month 7. **1, 3, 4 **& ** 5 **Life** **Paths** **Are Young Souls, **6** & **7** Life** **Paths Are Were the Souls Start To Mature, **8** Life** **Path Is the Tests of the Strength and Brilliance of a Soul, **9** Life** **Path Is the Test of the Mastery of a Soul, **11, 22 **& ** 33** Life** **Paths Are the Oldest Souls

8. Master Numbers **11**, **22** and **33** Dominate in This World 9. **9** Energy Makes Others Numbers a Better, Stronger Version of its Self. 

Therefore, for Example, a **9** Life Born on a **3** Day Is Great at Communicating or Has the Potential To Be Great at Communication, This Also Applies to People Born on **9** Days \(9th, 18th, 27th\) Where Their **9** Energy Makes Their Life Path a Better/Stronger Version of Itself. In This Case a **3** Life Path Born on a **9** Day Is Great at Communicating or Has the Potential To Be Great at Communication. This Also Applies to Being Born in a **9** Month or **9** Year. 

10. Your Current **Life Path** Tells a Lot About Your **Past Life** and if You Have Evolved. Numerology Is Based off of **Reincarnation**. Your Life Path Indicates What Level You’re on and How Many Levels You’ve Passed, Being You Will Keep Coming Back Until You Evolve From Whatever Life Path You Come Back as in Your Next Life Time. For Example, an **8** Life Path or Someone Born on a **8** Day \(8th, 17th, 26th\) or Has **8 Energy** \(Name, Month, Year, Attitude Number, Etc\) Has Completed **7 Life Path** and as a **8** Will Have To Learn Balance, Not To Abuse Power and Hold Grudges and Will Get Exactly What They Deserve \(Good or Bad\), Being **8** Is the Number of Karma 11. All **Addresses** Have an Energy, It’s Best for a Home Address To Add Up to **6** 

= Home & Family. Not Good To Buy or Stay in a House With 11 Energy \(Very Emotional\)

12. You Will Attract More Money Living at a Address That Adds Up to **8 **

~ 201 ~
